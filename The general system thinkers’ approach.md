Generalists use [[Inductive reasoning]] to draw general laws from cases not yet observed.

General systems thinking requires that we be naive like children and approach things with fresh eyes, fumble in the dark, make false conclusions and make fools of ourselves. This is how children learn so quickly and so well.

Stay general and take grand leaps. When we are wrong, we find this out more quickly. The general systems approach provides starting points for the study of many [[Complex systems]].
