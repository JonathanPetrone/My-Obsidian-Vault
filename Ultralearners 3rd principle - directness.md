Scott H. Young writes about directness as "the idea of learning being tied closely to the situation or context you want to use it in". When we learn something we should strive to tie it to the context we want to use it in.

This is important because transfering knowledge effectively is not always so easy if we just theorize (indirect learning), but weaving in practicing (direct learning) is very useful if we want to learn more effectively.

Transfering knowledge (i.e learning something from one context and being able to use it in another context) is harder when our knowledge is limited.

Learning directly can be uncomfartable and hard, this might be why we tend to favourize theorizing. Scott H. Young gives some suggestions on how we can learn with directness:

- **Tactic 1: Project-based learning** - Organize learning through producing something
- **Tactic 2: Immersive learning** - Surround yourself with the target environment
- **Tactic 3: The flight simulator method** - Simulate the environment
- **Tactic 4: The overkill approach** - Put yourself i an environment where the demands are extremely high, then you dont miss important lessons or feedback.
