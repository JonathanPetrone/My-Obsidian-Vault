"to attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, remove things everyday" - Lao Tzu

When we distill information we try to capture the most important aspect of it, it's essence. For example, each time you decide to add a highlight, you are developing your judgment: distinguishing the bits that truly matter from those that don't. In any piece of content, the value is not evenly distributed, thus it's important that we capture just the bare minimum.

The more economical you can be with the material you capture or store in your [[Second brain]] in the first place, the less time and effort your future self will have to go through it again (see: [[Future-proofing information]]).
