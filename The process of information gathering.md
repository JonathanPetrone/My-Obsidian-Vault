To gather or capture information we have to let go of expectations, there's no right way to go about it, and therefore, no wrong way. 

One way to start gathering information is to go into "divergence mode" (similar to: the first point James Bach brings up in [[A buccaneer-scholars self-education method]]), where you want to open up your horizons and explore every possible option. Click every link, jump from one source to another, and let your curiosity be your guide for what to do next. 

Then, when you find something you want to create a note about, ask yourself, how can I make this as useful as possible for my future self? That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your attention. Do remember to create breadcrumbs for yourself i.e references from where you got information so that you can follow up when you store it in your [[Second brain]] (see also: [[Future-proofing information]].)

It is important to separate the capturing/gathering of information from the organizing part of it so to not limit one-self ability to capture what resonates in the moment.

The process of information gathering fits with the stages of capturing and organizing in the [[CODE (model)]].
