Having more of a type will not increase the odds of getting that type's trinkets, outside of some not being offered unless you have at least 2 of that minion type.

Having a portrait minion has no extra impact on your likelihood to get their related trinket. You're no more likely to get a Smuggler's Portrait having a Whelp Smuggler on board vs. having any other Dragon

So the way it works is **it takes the pool of all possible trinkets in the lobby you could get, filters out ones you are ineligible for, and then random draws**. So hypothetically if you only wanted a minion type A trinket, it is technically correct to not have 2 minions from type B on your board.

Worth noting though that some typed trinkets can get offered to you even if you don't have that type on board. In that scenario though that trinket would be discounted to make it more appealing.
