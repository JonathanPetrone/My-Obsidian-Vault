The vast amount of information that's out there often overwhelmes us causing us information exhaustion, leading us to a poverty of attention.

For example:
- Every bit of energy we spend straining to recall things is energy not spent doing the thinking an being creative
- Every minute we spend trying to mentally juggle all the stuff we have to do leaves less time to act

One way to combat this is to build a [[Second brain]], where you keep only what resonates in a trusted place that you control, and to leave the rest aside.

This can lead you tohave a calmer mind, knowing that every important part of an idea/insight/information you have can be saved/tracked, which means that in the mean-time you can focus on other things.
