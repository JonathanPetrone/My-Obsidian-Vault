- Use <section> to separate content with HTML
- The <figure> element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption.
	- Like so: 
	<figure>

          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">

          <figcaption>Cats love lasagna.</figcaption>

	</figure>
- <em> makes text cursive and emphasized
- <strong> makes text bold
- The `action` attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, `<form action="/submit-url"></form>` tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path `/submit-url`.
- There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the `type` attribute in an input tag. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer.
- Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input. For example, `<input type="text" placeholder="Email address">`.
- The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's `action` attribute.
- `label` elements are used to help associate the text for an `input` element with the `input` element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers).
- The `fieldset` element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. `fieldset` elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.
- The `legend` element acts as a caption for the content in the `fieldset` element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.
- The `title` element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page.
- All pages should begin with `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.
- You can set browser behavior by adding self-closing `meta` elements in the `head`
