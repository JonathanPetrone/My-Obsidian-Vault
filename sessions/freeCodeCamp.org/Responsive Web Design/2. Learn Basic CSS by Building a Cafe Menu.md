- <article> tag is used for ...
- <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
- the browser has some default top margin for the `h1` element. this can be removed with styling margin-top: 0;

**Questions:**
- Best practices for designing and building a structure of CSS? Seems a little weird to mix % px and so on without making it hard to track.
