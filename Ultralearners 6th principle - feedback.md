Feedback is on of the most consistent aspects of the strategy "ultralearners" use. Ultralearners seek aggressive feedback. Ultralearners in general engage in immediate, accurate and intense feedback.

Engaging in this type of feedback pattern can sometimes be uncomfortable. The benefits of working with feedback in constructive ways is key to reaching expert levels of performance.

Any type of feedback aimed at a person's ego is often not constructive.

When we receive any kind of feedback react to it appropriately. We need to cherry pick what is useful, not overreact to certain bits and not try to react to every bit of information we get. We have to take into account the different types of feedback:

- **Outcome feedback** - Tells you how well you are doing, but not what you are doing well or bad. Useful for measuring how well we are doing overall according to some metric.
- **Informative feedback** - Tells you what you are doing wrong, but not how to fix it. This is easy to obtain when you have access to a real-time feedback source. This source can be present in the environment where the learning is taking place.
- **Corrective feedback** - This is the best kind of feedback we can get. This tells us what's wrong and how to fix it. need to be informative and usable by the recipient. Since this feedback is so valuable it is often preferable to not study in solitude and search out this type of feedback from a knowledgable tutor from time to time.

You might ask how quick should you be receiving feedback on something?
- Sometimes immediately is most useful, Scott H. Young recommends this most of the time.
- Sometimes it is most useful to delay the feedback some time. this could be especially true for hard problems.

In feedback there is usually signal (useful information) and noise (not useful information).

## Tactics for getting better feedback:

- **Tactic 1: Noise cancellation** - By modifying and selecting streams of feedback you can reduce the noise and get more of the signal in a message.
- **Tactic 2: Hitting the difficulty sweet spot** - Information that is hard to predict is more useful of an indicator when you receive it. If you always know you succeed as an example this is not useful information. This also realtes to situations that always make you feel good or bad.
- **Tactic 3: Metafeedback** - This tactic is not about evaluating the overrall knowledge or success, rather evaluating the strategy you are using to learn. One important type of metafeedback is your learning rate (information on how much you are learning in a set amount of time).
- **Tactic 4: High-intensity, rapid feedback** - This tactic revloves around you recieving a lot more feedback and also more often. This is especially useful when the default mode of learning involves little or infrequent feedback. This tactic can be hard to practice at first but becomes more and more useful when you are becoming more comfortable. This tactic provides both motivational and informational advantages.
