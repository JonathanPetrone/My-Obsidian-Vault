A class is a blueprint for an object. When you instantiate (create) an object, you use a class as the basis for how the object is built. A class defines the **attributes** (data) and **behaviors** (methods) that all objects created with this class will possess.

In OO software, the class comes first since an object cannot be instantiated without a class.

You can use [[UML]] (_Unified Modeling Language_) class diagrams to illustrate the classes that you build.

### Building blocks of a class

Classes generally consists of:
- **A class name**
	- For identification, preferably descriptive.
- **Comments**
	- Providing extra documentation.
- **Attributes**
	- Which stores data about objects, which could include references to other objects. 
- **Methods**
	- Public interface methods:
		- Constructor methods
		- Accessor methods
	- Private implementation methods:
		- Private methods called internally from the class itself
			- an example of this is anÂ internal method that provides encryption
