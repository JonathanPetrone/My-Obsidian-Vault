A class is a blueprint for an object. When you instantiate (create) an object, you use a class as the basis for how the object is built. A class defines the **attributes** (data) and **behaviors** (methods) that all objects created with this class will possess.

In OO software, the class comes first since an object cannot be instantiated without a class.

You can use UML (_Unified Modeling Language_) class diagrams to illustrate the classes that you build.
