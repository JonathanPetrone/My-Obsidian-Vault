When we create programs it is always good to prepare for things going wrong. If we know that things can go wrong we can come up with ways to handle situations that may arise that can cause us trouble.

In programming this is called error handling. There are some ways we can deal with these future potential problems.

- Ignore the problem.
- Check and abort the program if the problem is encountered.
	- You can then display a message, indicating the presence of the problem.
- Check and catch the mistake, and try to fix it.
	- You can try to implement fixes to potential problems in your code, that activates when some criteria is met. 
- Throw an exception.
