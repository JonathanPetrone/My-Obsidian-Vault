1. **Scout Obsessively**, look for resources you need to improve your education. Be curious. Browse bookstores, skim books, surf the Web, or read the dictionary. Lead yourself.

2. **Solve 'authentic problems'**, something you care about, not one that someone else thinks you should care about. If you can ignore the problem and it doesn't hurt you or cause you pain it's probably not authentic.

3. **Learn with cognitive savviness**, this means working with the rhythms of your mind. Thinking operates according to patterns and principles in your mind. Researchers call it "metacognition". Metacognition is the process of thinking about one's own thinking and learning.

4. **Knowledge Attracts Knowledge**, the more you know, the easier you learn. The more you know about a variety of different things, the more easily you will learn a specific thing in a pressure situation.

5. **Experimentation makes learning vivid and direct**. To experiment is to get close to it, question it, play with it, poke at it, and learn from what happens next.

6. **Disposable Time** is important as it lets you try new things. In buccaneer learning, wandering (i.e exploring) is a necessity, not a luxury. To wander effectively you need disposable time. Without disposable time, you will be conservative about what you learn and in turn suppress your curiosity.

7. **Stories** are how you can make sense of things. A story is a meaningful arrangement of ideas by someone. The author of a story highlights what he believes is relevant and suppresses what he believes is irrelevant by choosing what to say, what not to say, and how those ideas are sequenced and juxtaposed. The structure of a story helps us remember the ideas within it. To evaluate and learn from others stories you must practice critical thinking and how to dissect stories.

8. **Contrasting Ideas** lead to better ideas. This means challenging your beliefs with opposing ideas. It means asking probing questions, developing skeptical and critical habits to avoid being fooled or ambushed. 

9. **Other Minds**. Even though you are responsible for your own ideas, find time to listen and respond to other thinkers sometimes. You can get ideas from other people and then reinvent them for yourself.

10. **Words and Pictures** words and pictures are powerful tools for learning, refine your words and use a dictionary to understand the picture that sequences of text is painting.

11. **Systems Thinking** a system is a set of parts that interact: computer systems, buildings etc. are all examples of systems. Systems are all around us. From singlecell organisms to the universe, general systems thinking is the ability to see what’s essential for your purposes, ignore what isn’t, and reason about it. To simplify something, you must understand it.
