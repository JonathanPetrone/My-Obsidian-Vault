If a customer feels inspired to buy a product, they will verbalize the reasons why they are buying the product/service. In product development, the cause or philosophy which the company adheres to can help inspire customers and create loyal advocates. When the company becomes a symbol for deep-held beliefs in its customers it creates strong emotions in people.
