A design pattern is a reusable way of designing something. They revolve around the principle of best practices. A pattern generally has four elements:

- **Name**
	- It has a name.
- **Problem**
	- It has a problem it was created to solve.
- **Solution**
	- It has elements that make up its design.
- **Consequence**
	- It comes with some kind of trade-offs.


## Three general groups of design patterns in OO

- **Creational patterns** create objects for you, rather than having you instantiate objects directly. This gives your program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.
	- ex. *The factory method* that is useful when you dont know what kind of object you need before-hand.
- **Structural patterns** help you compose groups of objects into larger structures, such as complex user interfaces or accounting data.
	- ex. *The adapter design pattern* that is a way for you to create a different interface for a class that already exists. You create a new class that incorporates (wraps) the functionality of an existing class with a new and—ideally—better interface.
- **Behavioral patterns** help you define the communication between objects in your system and how the flow is controlled in a complex program.
	- ex. *The iterator design pattern* which provides a standard mechanism for traversing a collection, such as a vector. Functionality must be provided so that each item of the collection can be accessed one at a time. The iterator pattern provides information hiding, keeping the internal structure of the collection secure.

## Anti-patterns

Anti-patterns are practices to avoid. They emerge from failures of previous solutions. Thus, anti-patterns have the benefits of hindsight.
