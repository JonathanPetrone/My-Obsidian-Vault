Simon Baron-Cohen argues that there two neglected dimensions in differences between men and women (on average), the systemizing vs. empathizing dimensions.

**Baron-Cohen defines systemizing as:**

"...the drive to analyze, explore, and construct a system."

So the systemizer is interested in how things work or the underlying rules governing something.

**Baron-Cohen defines emphatizing as:**

"...the drive to identify another person's emotions and thoughts, and to respond to them with appropriate emotion"

So empathizing is about the natural desire of caring about others.
