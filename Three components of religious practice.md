According to David Steindl-Rast (an Austrian monk) religious practice starts with a doctrine, followed by ethics, and then ritual/s.

In other words:
It starts with some belief or set of beliefs that are taught and accepted by a particular group, then these beliefs start to control behavior, which leads to repetitive ways of doing things, i.e rituals.
