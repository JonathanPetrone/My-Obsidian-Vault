- **Neil Howe** you'll find either compelling or frustrating depending on how you weight pattern-matching vs. historical contingency. The Fourth Turning framework is essentially: societies move through ~80-year cycles (four "turnings" of ~20 years each), and we're entering a "crisis" phase where institutions collapse and rebuild. Critics say it's unfalsifiable post-hoc pattern-fitting; defenders say the demographic cohort dynamics (generations experiencing formative events at different life stages) create real structural pressures. The recent update tries to map COVID/2008/political polarization onto the 1930s-1940s crisis period. You'll know within 50 pages if the framework clicks for you.
	- Download the fourth coming -> Checked out, argues there is 4 periods (20 years each) cycling.
- **Morgan Housel** writes accessible behavioral finance/psychology. "The Psychology of Money" is his main work - short vignettes about how people actually make financial/life decisions vs. how rational models predict. The independence + purpose happiness formula fits your autonomous competence + intellectual synthesis drivers directly. His style is anecdotal rather than systematic, so if you prefer dense frameworks over illustrative stories, might feel thin. But he's good at extracting simple principles from messy human behavior.

- **Philip Pilkington** - Less known outside heterodox economics circles. Writes on macroeconomics, MMT-adjacent thinking, and recently on liberalism's structural contradictions (likely what Jimmy referenced). His work examines why liberal institutions can't sustain themselves under modern economic/technological conditions - similar tensions to what you're observing in your Alektum/CAB work where formal authority structures can't actually execute change. More technical than Housel, less cyclical-mystical than Howe.
	- **Seems dense and about macropolitics, maybe check out if he get invited somewhere**
