### Step 1: Information Inventory (Current State Mapping)

**Categorize by Input Type:**

- **Active Sources** (you seek out): newsletters, blogs, podcasts, books, courses
- **Passive Sources** (come to you): social media feeds, notifications, Slack channels, email lists
- **Interactive Sources** (you participate): communities, forums, meetings, conversations

**Categorize by Domain:**

- **Core Professional** (testing, Go, software architecture)
- **Growth Areas** (AI agents, systems thinking)
- **Industry Context** (fintech, debt collection, Swedish tech)
- **General** (news, entertainment, lifestyle)

### Step 2: Signal-to-Noise Analysis

**For each source, rate (1-5 scale):**

**Signal Strength:**

- **Actionability**: Can I immediately apply this information?
- **Uniqueness**: Is this information available elsewhere in better form?
- **Timing**: Is this information relevant to my current goals?
- **Depth**: Does this source provide nuanced understanding vs surface-level coverage?

**Noise Level:**

- **Redundancy**: How much overlap with other sources?
- **Distraction**: How often does this pull me away from priorities?
- **Emotional Load**: Does this create anxiety/FOMO without value?
- **Time Sink**: Effort required vs value extracted ratio

### Step 3: Strategic Filtering Matrix

Plot each source on this 2x2 matrix:

```
High Value, Low Effort → **Keep & Optimize**
High Value, High Effort → **Batch & Schedule**  
Low Value, Low Effort → **Question & Limit**
Low Value, High Effort → **Eliminate**
```

### Step 4: Information Diet Design

**Core Principles:**

- **Pull over Push**: Favor sources you actively choose vs those that interrupt
- **Primary over Secondary**: Favor original research/thinking vs commentary
- **Synthesis over Consumption**: Favor sources that connect ideas vs isolated facts

**Implementation Structure:**

- **Daily Inputs** (15-30 min): Highest signal sources only
- **Weekly Deep Dives** (2-3 hours): Batch process medium-value sources
- **Monthly Reviews** (1 hour): Audit and adjust the system

### Step 5: Optimization Actions

**Immediate Actions:**

- Unsubscribe from sources scoring below 3/5 on signal strength
- Set up filters/folders to batch similar content
- Create "read later" systems for valuable but non-urgent content

**System Improvements:**

- Set up RSS feeds to centralize high-value sources
- Use AI tools to summarize lengthy but valuable content
- Create templates for capturing insights from each source type

### Step 6: Feedback Loop

**Weekly Questions:**

- What information did I act on this week?
- What sources consistently provided unique value?
- Where did I waste time on low-value information?

**Monthly Adjustments:**

- Add sources that repeatedly come recommended by trusted networks
- Remove sources that haven't provided actionable insights
- Adjust time allocation based on actual value delivered

## Implementation Template

Create a spreadsheet with these columns:

- Source Name
- Type (Active/Passive/Interactive)
- Domain Category
- Signal Score (1-5)
- Noise Score (1-5)
- Time Investment (hours/week)
- Last Actionable Insight (date)
- Decision (Keep/Batch/Limit/Eliminate)

**Red Flags to Watch For:**

- Sources you check out of habit rather than purpose
- Information that makes you feel informed but doesn't change behavior
- Duplicate coverage across multiple sources
- Content that triggers emotional responses without providing solutions
