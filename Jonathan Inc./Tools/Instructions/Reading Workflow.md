## Workflow:

1. Read chapter
2. Mark any sentences that resonate
3. Finish chapter
4. Capture marked text in Obsidian
5. **Add one-phrase tag to each extract**: "challenges X", "operationalizes Y", "connects A→B", "example of Z", "unclear/revisit"
6. When novelty fades mid-book: **Pause and diagnose**
    - Ask: "Am I capturing redundant expressions of known insights, or is the book actually repetitive?"
    - If redundant capture: Switch to annotation mode—mark _why_ passage is redundant ("3rd example of X concept")
    - If book is repetitive: Skim remaining chapters for structural novelty (new topics/tensions), extract only those sections deeply
7. Iterate through book with steps 1-6
8. **After finishing book: Review all extracts with tags**
9. **Shorten extracts within tag groups**—compress collectively when multiple extracts share a tag
10. **Group shortened extracts by conceptual cluster** (tags help scaffold this, but clusters may cross tag boundaries)
11. **Framework filter: Does a cluster have 3+ distinct-but-related insights?**
    - Yes → Build framework with me
    - No → Keep as standalone provocations or archive
12. **After framework creation: Schedule 7-day review** to evaluate if framework is generative (changed thinking/behavior) or archival (satisfying but inert)
