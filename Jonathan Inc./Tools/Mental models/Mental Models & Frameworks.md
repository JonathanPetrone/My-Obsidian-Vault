### Inverted U Principle
_When evaluating any trait, behavior, or intervention_ 

Recognize that "too little of something is not good, too much of something is not good" and seek the optimal middle point.

### Parasitic Pattern Recognition
_When evaluating ideas, institutions, or behaviors_ 

Ask: "Does this extract value without contributing to the host's survival/flourishing?" Apply to ideologies, institutional changes, or personal relationships that drain resources without reciprocal benefit.

### Sacrifice-as-Capability Framework 
*When deciding whether to give up present benefits.*

Ask: "Does this sacrifice expand or contract my future range of possibilities and capabilities? Look for sacrifices that compound your agency rather than diminish it, regardless of whether you can identify the 'right' end goal.
###### Red flags for "dead" sacrifice:
- Giving up things primarily to meet external expectations
- Trading capabilities for social approval
- Sacrificing in ways that make you more fragile or dependent
###### Green flags for "living" sacrifice:
- The constraints actually enhance your ability to develop specific capabilities
- You're trading lower-order freedoms for higher-order agency
- The sacrifice builds transferable skills or resilience

### Signal vs. Noise Optimization
*When using AI tools or processing information*

Focus on improving input quality rather than speed/efficiency - put more effort into crafting detailed, context-rich prompts rather than expecting AI to compensate for low-quality inputs.

### Progressive Contextualization
_When building understanding or creating solutions_ 

Start with broad AI-generated responses, then progressively add specific context and constraints to refine outputs toward practical application

### Hierarchy of Aims Framework
*When setting goals or making decisions about what to pursue in life.*

Structure your aims hierarchically - each immediate goal should serve a higher purpose, which serves an even higher purpose, continuing upward. Ask "why" repeatedly: Why this job? → To get degree → To serve family → To build lasting value → To serve the highest good. This prevents nihilism and provides meaning to micro-actions.
