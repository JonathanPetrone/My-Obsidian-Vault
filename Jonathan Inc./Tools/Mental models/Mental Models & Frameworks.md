### Adaptive Optimization over Standardized Performance
*When facing pressure to conform or when questioning whether you're optimizing for the right things*

**True intelligence lies in optimizing yourself as a system according to your core identity and authentic nature**, rather than maximizing performance on standardized measures that may not align with your design. Instead of asking "How can I get better at this standard measure?" ask "What would optimal functioning look like for my specific system?" A dolphin shouldn't try to become better at climbing trees - it should become the best dolphin it can be within its aquatic environment.

### The Main Article of General Systems Faith
*When stuck on a problem in your domain or when your usual approaches aren't working*

**Search other fields for similar problems**; nature tends to reuse successful solutions across domains. Imagine being trapped in a maze and realizing that maybe ant colonies, river systems, or neural networks have already "solved" similar navigation problems. The faith part is believing that cross-pollination will work - that solutions from biology might unlock engineering problems, or that physics principles might illuminate social dynamics.

### The Growth Partnership Filter 
*When evaluating relationships (romantic, friendship, work)*

**Define relationships as agreements between people to grow together.** Both parties commit to personal development while supporting each other's growth. Explicitly discuss growth intentions. Look for people who hold you accountable when you mess up and teach you new things. 

Red flag: One person doing all the growing. 
Green flag: Mutual challenge and support.

### The Serendipity Maximization Meta-Framework
_When you don't know what to work on or need breakthrough insights_

**Deliberately increase your surface area for unexpected discoveries** by maximizing exposure to diverse inputs, people, and experiences. This amplifies the effectiveness of other frameworks.

Ask:
- Am I optimizing for interestingness rather than certainty?
- Am I exposing myself to ideas and people outside my current domain?
- When in doubt, am I choosing the path that maximizes learning and connections?

### Systems Leverage Levels
*When wanting to make changes to a system*

**Recognize that systems have different levels of leverage.**

From highest to lowest leverage:
- Paradigm - Goals, Paradigms
- Rules / Power - Self-Organization, Rules
- Information and Control - Information Flows and Feedback Loops
- Physical structure - Delays and Stock-and-Flow Structures
- Parameters - Number and Buffers

### NICE Goals over SMART Goals
*When setting objectives that you struggle to maintain*

**Replace outcome-focused SMART goals with process-focused NICE goals**, this will allow me to have good energy throughout and make me more likely to commit.

NICE-goals are:
- Near-term (daily or weekly)
- Input-based (action oriented rather than based on results)
- Controllable (within your direct influence) 
- Energizing (makes you feel good)

### The Constraint-Freedom Paradox Framework
_When feeling overwhelmed by options, seeking expertise, or noticing scattered/inefficient approaches_

**The more constraints you internalize about your optimal operating conditions, the more freedom you gain to perform at higher levels.** Like a master craftsman who has absorbed so many limitations about their medium that creation becomes effortless, true expertise emerges from choosing the right boundaries rather than avoiding all boundaries. The paradox is that by deliberately limiting your options, you unlock capabilities that infinite choice cannot provide.

[[The Constraint-Freedom Paradox Framework]]:
1. **Discover constraints** through pattern recognition in your energy and performance
2. **Adopt limitations** that channel effort toward strengths while eliminating decision fatigue
3. **Master within bounds** until constraints become unconscious enablers
4. **Evolve constraints** when current frameworks limit growth, allowing more sophisticated boundaries to emerge

### Maximum Intensity and Complete Recovery
_When structuring practice or performance_

**Alternate between periods of maximum intensity and complete recovery rather than maintaining constant moderate effort.** 

Work at 100% intensity for specific intervals, then recover completely before the next interval. Gradually increase intensity duration and decrease recovery time. Apply to both physical and mental training.

### Meet Emotion with Emotion, Facts with Facts 
*When someone is in an emotional state*

**Recognize whether someone (including yourself) is in an emotional or rational state, then respond appropriately.** When emotions are high, lead with empathy and understanding. Save rational analysis for when emotions have subsided. 

For emotional states use phrases like "That really hurts" or "This is really hard" instead of trying to solve or rationalize. Wait 2-3 days, then ask permission: "Can I offer some thoughts?"

### The Power of Human Interpretation
*When building systems or solving problems*

**We as humans know more than we can say** (see: [[Polanyi's paradox]]), therefore it is highly unlikely we can program this into computers. [[Tacit Knowledge]] represents the final frontier on which humans outperform machines still to this day. Jobs that require the ability to convey particular interpretations of information are the least likely to be automated by machines in the future.

### Structural Change vs. Speed Enhancement Framework
When evaluating AI implementation

Instead of asking "How can AI help with this task?", **ask "How does AI change what the task fundamentally is?"** True transformation occurs when both the work artifact AND the workflow change, not just the speed of existing processes.

Nadella's example:
When we went from fax to email/Excel this completely changed the work artifact and process, not just the speed.

We need to ask: 
- Are we changing job scopes/roles or just adding AI tools to existing roles?
- Does this shift to where humans spend cognitive cycles (more prefrontal cortex work, less mundane information gathering)?

### The Scaling Constraint Mental Model 
*When designing systems or predicting where they'll break at different sizes*

Every system faces the fundamental tension: surface area (capacity) grows as the square, but volume (demand) grows as the cube. **Instead of asking "How can I make this bigger?" ask "What dimensional mismatches will emerge, and how can I design around them?"**

The ant doesn't try to become an elephant - it optimizes its design for its scale. True system robustness comes from working with geometric realities rather than fighting them. Success comes from recognizing which aspects of your system are 2D constraints (structural support, interface area, processing capacity) and which are 3D demands (load, complexity, resource requirements), then designing the system to thrive within that relationship rather than against it.

### Signal vs. Noise Optimization
*When using AI tools or processing information*

**Focus on improving input quality rather than speed/efficiency** - put more effort into crafting detailed, context-rich prompts rather than expecting AI to compensate for low-quality inputs.

### The Service Filter 
*When unsure which decision to make*

**Ask: "How can I be of service?"** - this principle leads to fulfilling and satisfying outcomes. It transcends ego-driven decision making, creates positive-sum outcomes naturally, builds reputation and relationships automatically, generates intrinsic motivation rather than requiring external rewards.

### Sacrifice-as-Capability Framework 
*When deciding whether to give up present benefits.*

**Ask: "Does this sacrifice expand or contract my future range of possibilities and capabilities?** Look for sacrifices that compound your agency rather than diminish it, regardless of whether you can identify the 'right' end goal.
###### Red flags for "dead" sacrifice:
- Giving up things primarily to meet external expectations
- Trading capabilities for social approval
- Sacrificing in ways that make you more fragile or dependent
###### Green flags for "living" sacrifice:
- The constraints actually enhance your ability to develop specific capabilities
- You're trading lower-order freedoms for higher-order agency
- The sacrifice builds transferable skills or resilience

### The Mission-Project-Task Hierarchy Filter 
*When deciding what work to accept or prioritize*

**Filter potential work through three commitment levels with strict limits.** This prevents scope creep and maintains focus on core objectives. 
Ask:
- Missions (2-3 max): What are my core professional/learning objectives?
- Projects (active limit of 3): What initiatives advance these missions?
- Tasks: What supports active projects without creating new obligations?

Red flag: New opportunities that don't clearly fit existing missions.

### The Hammer-Nail Fallacy Check
_When using any heuristic device or rule of thumb_

**Remember that heuristic devices don't tell you when to stop applying them.** The better you get at using a tool, the more likely you are to see every problem as a nail for your hammer. Real-world examples include. 

- **Reductionist thinking** - Breaking things into parts works great for machines, terrible for understanding consciousness or love
- **Economic models** - Supply and demand explains a lot, but not everything (like why people pay $5 for coffee they could make for 50¢)

### Occam's Razor 
*When choosing between competing explanations*

**Prefer the simpler explanation with fewer assumptions**. Complex explanations require more things to go right - each additional variable increases chance of error. Ask: Which explanation requires the fewest assumptions? Am I making this more complicated than necessary? 

Warning signs: Overly elaborate theories requiring perfect coordination.

### The Orientation vs. Purpose Filter
 _When setting goals or evaluating life direction_

**Application:** Distinguish between destination-focused purposes (which create meaninglessness upon achievement or failure) and orientation-focused direction (which provides ongoing meaning). 

**Decision Criteria:**
- Does this goal make my life meaningless if I don't achieve it?
- Will achieving this goal leave me directionless afterward?
- Am I oriented toward what is true, good, and beautiful, or just what I want?
- Is this reality-centric or ego-centric?

**Implementation Details:** Frame goals as infinite games (ongoing play) rather than finite games (win/lose). Focus on who you're becoming rather than what you're achieving. Red flag: "My life will be complete when..." Green flag: "This helps me stay oriented toward..." 

Source: Vervaeke's critique of standard purpose-driven approaches to meaning.
### Hierarchy of Aims Framework
*When setting goals or making decisions about what to pursue in life.*

**Structure your aims hierarchically** - each immediate goal should serve a higher purpose, which serves an even higher purpose, continuing upward. 

**Ask "why" repeatedly:** Why this job? → To get degree → To serve family → To build lasting value → To serve the highest good. This prevents nihilism and provides meaning to micro-actions.

### The Reverse Pilot
_When questioning existing commitments or initiatives_

**Test whether removing an existing activity causes any negative consequences.** Quietly eliminate or scale back for a few weeks to assess true value.

Ask: "If I didn't already have this commitment, how much would I invest to acquire it?" and "What would happen if we stopped doing this entirely?"

Process: Stop doing it without announcement → Wait and observe → Measure actual vs. assumed impact.

Green flags: No one notices, no negative consequences, freed time enables higher-value work. Red flags: Emotional attachment to activity rather than objective value assessment.

Source: Essentialism book (G. McKeown)

### The Quality-Leverage Decision Matrix
_When choosing between competing opportunities_

Evaluate opportunities based on quality demands and leverage for future freedom. **Quality work creates options; busy work creates more busy work.**

Ask: Does this require me to operate at my highest capability? Will completing this well give me more control over future projects? Does this build skills that increase my autonomy?

Green flags: Projects where you can significantly exceed normal standards and build transferable capabilities. 

Red flags: High-maintenance, low-skill work that creates dependency rather than freedom.

Source: Slow Productivity (C. Newport)

### Creating Your Own Earthquake
_When needing to achieve peak performance states_

**Identify what external conditions trigger your best performance, then learn to recreate those internal states without external dependency.**

Ask: "When do I perform at my absolute best?" "What internal state do these conditions create?" "How can I trigger this state without external conditions?"

Process: Map peak performance experiences → Identify the internal feeling → Create routine that produces this state → Condense routine until minimal triggers produce maximum effect.

Source: The Art of Learning (J. Waitzkin)

## **Illusion of Competence Detection**
_When evaluating whether you actually understand material_

Use recall testing rather than recognition testing. Look away from material and see what you can reproduce. **If you can't recall it without looking, you don't actually know it yet.**

Ask: Am I confusing familiarity with mastery? Can I reproduce this knowledge without looking at the source? Am I relying too heavily on highlighting or rereading?

Process: After studying, close the book and write/say what you remember → Test in different contexts → Repeat until solutions "flow like a song."

Red flags: Feeling confident after just reading/highlighting. 
Green flags: Struggling initially with recall but improving over time.
