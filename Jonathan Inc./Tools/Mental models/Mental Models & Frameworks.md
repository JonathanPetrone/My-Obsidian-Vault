### The Main Article of General Systems Faith
*When stuck on a problem in your domain or when your usual approaches aren't working*

Search other fields for similar problems; nature tends to reuse successful solutions across domains. Imagine being trapped in a maze and realizing that maybe ant colonies, river systems, or neural networks have already "solved" similar navigation problems. The faith part is believing that cross-pollination will work - that solutions from biology might unlock engineering problems, or that physics principles might illuminate social dynamics.

### The Constraint-Freedom Paradox Framework
_When feeling overwhelmed by options, seeking expertise, or noticing scattered/inefficient approaches_

The more constraints you internalize about your optimal operating conditions, the more freedom you gain to perform at higher levels. Like a master craftsman who has absorbed so many limitations about their medium that creation becomes effortless, true expertise emerges from choosing the right boundaries rather than avoiding all boundaries. The paradox is that by deliberately limiting your options, you unlock capabilities that infinite choice cannot provide.

[[The Constraint-Freedom Paradox Framework]]:
1. **Discover constraints** through pattern recognition in your energy and performance
2. **Adopt limitations** that channel effort toward strengths while eliminating decision fatigue
3. **Master within bounds** until constraints become unconscious enablers
4. **Evolve constraints** when current frameworks limit growth, allowing more sophisticated boundaries to emerge

### Signal vs. Noise Optimization
*When using AI tools or processing information*

Focus on improving input quality rather than speed/efficiency - put more effort into crafting detailed, context-rich prompts rather than expecting AI to compensate for low-quality inputs.

### The Service Filter 
*When unsure which decision to make*

Ask: "How can I be of service?" - this principle leads to fulfilling and satisfying outcomes. It transcends ego-driven decision making, creates positive-sum outcomes naturally, builds reputation and relationships automatically, generates intrinsic motivation rather than requiring external rewards.

### Sacrifice-as-Capability Framework 
*When deciding whether to give up present benefits.*

Ask: "Does this sacrifice expand or contract my future range of possibilities and capabilities? Look for sacrifices that compound your agency rather than diminish it, regardless of whether you can identify the 'right' end goal.
###### Red flags for "dead" sacrifice:
- Giving up things primarily to meet external expectations
- Trading capabilities for social approval
- Sacrificing in ways that make you more fragile or dependent
###### Green flags for "living" sacrifice:
- The constraints actually enhance your ability to develop specific capabilities
- You're trading lower-order freedoms for higher-order agency
- The sacrifice builds transferable skills or resilience

### The Hammer-Nail Fallacy Check
_When using any heuristic device or rule of thumb_

Remember that heuristic devices don't tell you when to stop applying them. The better you get at using a tool, the more likely you are to see every problem as a nail for your hammer. Real-world examples include. 

- **Reductionist thinking** - Breaking things into parts works great for machines, terrible for understanding consciousness or love
- **Economic models** - Supply and demand explains a lot, but not everything (like why people pay $5 for coffee they could make for 50¢)

### Hierarchy of Aims Framework
*When setting goals or making decisions about what to pursue in life.*

Structure your aims hierarchically - each immediate goal should serve a higher purpose, which serves an even higher purpose, continuing upward. Ask "why" repeatedly: Why this job? → To get degree → To serve family → To build lasting value → To serve the highest good. This prevents nihilism and provides meaning to micro-actions.

### Parasitic Pattern Recognition
_When evaluating ideas, institutions, or behaviors_ 

Ask: "Does this extract value without contributing to the host's survival/flourishing?" Apply to ideologies, institutional changes, or personal relationships that drain resources without reciprocal benefit.

### Progressive Contextualization
_When building understanding or creating solutions_ 

Start with broad AI-generated responses, then progressively add specific context and constraints to refine outputs toward practical application

### Inverted U Principle
_When evaluating any trait, behavior, or intervention_ 

Recognize that "too little of something is not good, too much of something is not good" and seek the optimal middle point.
