### Core Identity First
*When facing pressure to conform or when questioning whether you're optimizing for the right things*

Aristotle argued that every being has a **telos** (purpose or end goal) determined by its essential nature. For humans, eudaimonia - often translated as "happiness" but better understood as "flourishing" or "living well" - comes from actualizing your essential human capacities.

**True intelligence lies in optimizing yourself as a system according to your core identity and authentic nature**, rather than maximizing performance on standardized measures that may not align with your design. A dolphin shouldn't try to become better at climbing trees - it should become the best dolphin it can be within its aquatic environment.

### Faith in the Analogical Leap
*When stuck on a problem in your domain or when your usual approaches aren't working*

Nature tends to reuse successful solutions across domains. Imagine being trapped in a maze and realizing that maybe ant colonies, river systems, or neural networks have already "solved" similar navigation problems. The faith part is believing that cross-pollination will work - that solutions from biology might unlock engineering problems, or that physics principles might illuminate social dynamics.

When stuck or searching for inspiration we should therefore also search in other fields or environments for similar problems and their corresponding solutions.

### The Growth Partnership Filter 
*When evaluating relationships (romantic, friendship, work)*

**Define relationships as agreements between people to grow together.** Both parties commit to personal development while supporting each other's growth. Explicitly discuss growth intentions. Look for people who hold you accountable when you mess up and teach you new things. 

Red flag: One person doing all the growing. 
Green flag: Mutual challenge and support.

### Occam's Razor
*When choosing between competing explanations*

This principle points us to prefer the simpler explanation with fewer assumptions. Complex explanations require more things to go right - each additional variable increases the chance of error.

Ask: 
- Which explanation requires the fewest assumptions?
- Am I making this more complicated than necessary?

### The Deep Leverage Approach
_For creating lasting change in any system_

If possible start where your effort creates the biggest impact.

From highest to lowest leverage:
- **Paradigm** (Goals, Paradigms) → _Change the fundamental logic that governs the system_
- **Rules / Power** (Self-Organization, Rules) → _Modify the protocols and authority structures_
- **Information and Control** (Information Flows and Feedback Loops) → _Alter what data flows where and when_
- **Physical structure** (Delays and Stock-and-Flow Structures) → _Redesign the physical connections and timing constraints_
- **Parameters** (Numbers and Buffers) → _Adjust the numerical settings within existing architecture_

### The Systematic Curiosity Approach
_When you don't know what to work on or need breakthrough insights_

**Deliberately increase your surface area for unexpected discoveries** by maximizing exposure to diverse inputs, people, and experiences. This amplifies the effectiveness of other frameworks.

Ask:
- Am I optimizing for interestingness rather than certainty?
- Am I exposing myself to ideas and people outside my current domain?
- When in doubt, am I choosing the path that maximizes learning and connections?

### The Progressive Inquiry Model
_When facing problems, opportunities, or the need for innovation_

**Application:** Three-stage questioning framework: Why (step back, understand context), What If (divergent thinking, unusual connections), How (rapid experimentation with prototypes).

**Key Decision Points:**

- **Why:** Are you questioning assumptions rather than accepting "the way things are"?
- **What If:** Are you allowing wide-open thinking and making unexpected connections?
- **How:** Are you starting with imperfect prototypes and learning from failure?

**Green flags:** Questions that challenge conventional wisdom, ideas combining unexpected elements, rapid experimentation **Red flags:** Analysis paralysis, obvious solutions, perfectionism preventing testing **Key practice:** Live with questions rather than rushing to answers

### Via Negativa
_For complex or poorly understood problems where failure modes are clearer than success patterns_

Define what you're solving for by establishing hard boundaries (what absolutely cannot happen) rather than optimizing towards ideal outcomes.

It's often easier to identify deal-breakers & failures often have universal patterns.

Example:
- List what would be catastrophic failure
- Design constraints that make these failures impossible
- Optimize within what is left

Decision-making example:
- Instead of the "perfect job" eliminate roles with deal-breakers

### Frankl's Meaning-Centered Framework
_When completion energy drops despite knowing the work matters_

Core Principles:
- A strong "why" enables you to bear almost any "how"
- You can always choose your response to any situation
- Commitments to the future builds psychological resilience
- Don't pursue happiness success directly, they emerge as a side-effect of self-transcendence
- Self-transcendence comes from building meaning through directing attention outward (people, causes, work, truth etc.). Discovered through engagement with the world.
- Meaning is unique to each person
- Meaning-seeking failure creates boredom, emptiness, or addiction

### The Four-Layered System Framework
_For diagnosing where a problem actually lives, to separate the malfunctioning from core identity or being_

**The four layers**:
1. **Substrate** - Material, hardware, physical matters -> Physical, measurable, can be damaged or modified
2. **Patterns** - Structures, rules, mental models, software -> Information structure, can be reprogrammed or learned
3. **Phenomenon** - The emergent whole, the running application -> Emergent, has properties neither substrate nor patterns have alone, can be described but hard to locate.
4. **Witness** - The experiencing/observing perspective -> The locus of experience, it will be debatable if its separate or emergent from Layer 3.

Layer 4's ontological status varies by domain type.

Is there a layer 4 in all systems? (Hard to say)
Question: Is there an experiencer separate from the experience or is the experiencer just a pattern within the experience?

### Classify-Then-Act Framework
_For understanding which approach is effective in the problem domain_

Complicated = Stable/knowable, consistent patterns, mechanical
Complex = Emergent/shifting, fuzzy boundaries, hidden relationships

If the problem is complicated:
- Map parts -> Identify leverage -> Sequential small wins

If the problem is complex:
- Safe-to-fail probes -> Stabilize/learn -> Map parts -> Small wins

If the problem is unclear:
- Run cheap experiments

### Science Describes How, Not What
_When tempted to dismiss questions as "unscientific" or when conflating predicting power with explanatory completeness_

Science operates through quantities ( mass, wavelength, temperature) which are abstractions derived from qualities.

Scientific methodology deliberately constrains itself to third-person, quantifiable observations - this is a strength not a failure.

However, the map is not the territory. Science produces very accurate maps - mathematical models that predict patterns and behaviors. But this doesn't mean it captures what something "is" only behaviors,

Science's domains -> Pattern, predictions & functional relationships

For questions about subjective experience or the ontological nature of things other investigative approaches are required.

### The Elimination Experiment
_When questioning existing commitments or initiatives_

Test whether removing an existing activity causes any negative consequences.

1. If you didn't already have this commitment, how much would you invest in acquiring it?
2. What would actually happen if you stopped doing it?

Stop it without announcement -> Measure actual impact

### The Matthew Principle
_When struggling with starting it's a motivation that good things will inevitably come from putting in effort and accumulating resources_

From the "Gospel of Matthew":

"For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away"

Example:
	- Those with knowledge acquire new knowledge faster

This mechanism typically involves positive feedback loops: initial advantages create conditions that generate future advantages. The opposite is true as well.

### Qualia vs. Quantities
_For deeper understanding of different approaches and their tradeoffs_

**Qualia** -> Intrinsic, phenomenal qualities
	Linked to Idealism, which says reality is fundamentally mental or experiential in nature.

**Quantities** -> Measurable, numerical properties
	Linked to Materialism, which says that reality is fundamentally physical.

**Qualia** focused problem solving:
	Strengths: Early pattern recognition, innovation, holistic view
	Weaknesses: Personal bias, doesn't scale, harder to communicate

**Quantities** focused problem solving:
	Strengths: Scalable, clear communication, reproducibility
	Weaknesses: Gaming metrics vs. real goals, delay in feedback

### The Two Modes of Epistemic Knowing
*When deciding how to approach certain problems or evaluating what counts as "real" knowledge*

The Socratic standard privileges explicit articulation: you only "know" what you can break into rules and logical steps. This rationalist approach ("If X then Y") works brilliantly for physics.

But much of reality resists explicit theorizing. Pattern-based knowing—intuition from thousands of hours of experience—produces accurate judgments without accessible reasoning chains. LLMs demonstrate this is legitimate knowledge: coherent outputs without explainable reasoning, mirroring how human intuition functions in complex domains.

Heuristic:
- Complicated domains (many parts, deterministic) → rules-based knowing
- Complex domains (emergent, context-dependent) → pattern-based knowing

Physics found universal laws. Social sciences failed replicating this approach (replication crisis) due to domain mismatch, not methodology. Human behavior is fundamentally context-dependent. Trust pattern recognition that works even when you can't explain why.

### The Question Toggle Framework
_When stuck in unproductive loops or drowning in infinite possibilities_

Questions aren't neutral - their structure determines what you can see. 
- **Open questions** ("Why does this fail?") excavate assumptions and expand search space. 
- **Closed questions** ("Does this fail?") force binary choices and create boundaries. 

The same logic applies to identity: "How might I reduce organizational dysfunction?" keeps you adaptive; "I am a Test Lead" locks you into a static role.

**The frame is the decision.** When you're stuck, you're probably asking closed questions that confirm existing beliefs. When you're paralyzed by options, you need closed questions to create actionable constraints. Recognizing which mode serves the moment is crucial and then to toggle deliberately.

Ask:
- Is this question confirming what I already believe or challenging my assumptions?
- Am I stuck because my question is too narrow, or drowning because it's too broad?
- Does my current frame enable discovery or force premature closure?
