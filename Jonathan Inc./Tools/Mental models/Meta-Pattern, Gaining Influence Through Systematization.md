## Structure:
1. Identify chaos/gap where no one owns the problem
2. Build minimal system that solves painful instance
3. Document/systematize so others can use it
4. Teach others to use the system (multiplies your impact)
5. Gain influence as "the person who brings order"
6. Hand off to others when system is self-sustaining
7. Move to next chaos

## Why it works:
- Low competition (most people avoid chaos)
- High value (organizations desperately need order)
- Compounds influence (each system adds to reputation)
- Enables exit (system runs without you)

## Critical insight:
The product isn't expertise - it's SYSTEMS.
Expertise is the input, transferable systems are the output.

## Instances:
- Accessibility documentation at 1177 (2 years)
- Testing curriculum creation (2 years)  
- Process building at Alektum (ongoing, likely 2-3 years total)

## What I'm learning at each stage:
- 1177: How to systematize technical knowledge
- Teaching: How to make tacit knowledge explicit
- Alektum: How to build systems in political/chaotic environments

## Acceleration:
- 1177: 12+ months to figure out the pattern
- Teaching: 6 months to apply systematization pattern in new domain
- Alektum: Immediately recognized "chaos = opportunity to build systems"

## Next niche hypothesis:
Look for: Organization with chaos in emerging technical area (AI governance, security, accessibility in new domain) where I can build systematic approach before "best practices" exist
