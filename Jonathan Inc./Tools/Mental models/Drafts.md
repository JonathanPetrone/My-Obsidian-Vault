## **The Mission-Project-Task Hierarchy Filter** - _When deciding what work to accept or prioritize_

**Application:** Filter all potential work through three levels of commitment, with strict limits at each level. This prevents scope creep at every scale and maintains focus on what matters most.

**Decision Criteria:**

- **Missions (2-3 max):** What are my core professional objectives?
- **Projects (active limit of 3):** What substantial initiatives advance these missions?
- **Tasks:** What small items support active projects without creating new obligations?

**Implementation Details:**

- **Mission Level:** Annually review and ruthlessly limit to 2-3 core areas
- **Project Level:** Maintain active list of max 3 projects; hold others in "waiting tank"
- **Task Level:** Group similar tasks and batch process rather than constant switching
- **Red Flag:** When new opportunities don't clearly fit existing missions
- **Implementation:** Regular weekly review to ensure alignment across all three levels

**[Throughput Optimization]** - When accelerating learning - Maximize invalidated assumptions per unit time, not just knowledge acquisition

## **Creating Your Own Earthquake** - _When needing to achieve peak performance states_

**Application:** Identify what external conditions trigger your best performance, then learn to recreate those internal states without external dependency. **Decision Criteria:** Ask: "When do I perform at my absolute best?" "What internal state do these conditions create?" "How can I trigger this state without external conditions?" **Implementation Details:** Map your peak performance experiences. Identify the internal feeling/state. Create a routine that produces this state. Gradually condense the routine until minimal triggers produce maximum effect. **Source Context:** Waitzkin's realization that he performed best during chaotic situations (like earthquakes) and learned to create that heightened state at will.

## **Universality Recognition Framework** 
_When trying to determine if insights from one domain apply to another_ 
**Application:** Look for mathematical or structural similarities across seemingly different domains. If you find universal patterns (like period-doubling, scaling relationships, or fractal structures), solutions from one field may transfer to another. **Decision Criteria:** Do these systems share similar mathematical structures? Are there common bifurcation points? Do they exhibit similar scaling behaviors or geometric patterns? **Implementation Details:** Abstract away surface differences to find underlying mathematical relationships. Test whether changing parameters produces similar sequences of behavior changes. Green flag: Finding the same numerical constants or ratios appearing across domains. Red flag: Forcing analogies based on superficial similarities. **Source Context:** Feigenbaum's discovery that the same mathematical constants appeared in completely different physical systems undergoing transitions to chaos.

### **The Scaling Constraint Mental Model:** 
_When designing systems or predicting where they'll break at different sizes_

Every system exists within the fundamental tension between dimensional constraints - your 2D capabilities trying to support your 3D demands. True system robustness comes from designing within these geometric realities rather than fighting them. Instead of asking "How can I make this bigger?" ask "What are the dimensional mismatches that will emerge, and how can I design around them?"

Think of it as the Universal Scaling Law: Surface area (your capacity) grows as the square, but volume (your load) grows as the cube. This isn't a limitation to overcome - it's a design constraint to work with. The ant doesn't try to become an elephant; it optimizes its design for its scale. The elephant doesn't try to move like an ant; it uses different strategies appropriate to its dimensional reality.

**The key insight:** Every scaling challenge is really a dimensional design challenge. Success comes from recognizing which aspects of your system are 2D constraints (structural support, interface area, processing capacity) and which are 3D demands (load, complexity, resource requirements), then designing the system to thrive within that relationship rather than against it.
## **Occam's Razor** - _When choosing between competing explanations_

**Application:** When multiple explanations seem equally valid, prefer the simpler one with fewer assumptions. Complex explanations require more things to go right.

**Decision Criteria:**

- Which explanation requires the fewest assumptions?
- What's the probability that all required elements are correct?
- Does added complexity actually improve explanatory power?
- Am I making this more complicated than necessary?

**Implementation Details:**

- **Mathematical logic:** Each additional variable increases chance of error
- **Applications:** Troubleshooting, root cause analysis, strategic planning
- **Limitations:** Some things genuinely are complex; don't oversimplify irreducible complexity
- **Warning signs:** Overly elaborate conspiracy theories; solutions requiring perfect coordination

**Source Context:** From William of Ockham's principle, illustrated through examples like dark matter theory and simple solutions to complex problems (bird balls for reservoir shading). The great mental models book
## **The Orientation vs. Purpose Filter** - _When setting goals or evaluating life direction_

**Application:** Distinguish between destination-focused purposes (which create meaninglessness upon achievement or failure) and orientation-focused direction (which provides ongoing meaning). **Decision Criteria:**

- Does this goal make my life meaningless if I don't achieve it?
- Will achieving this goal leave me directionless afterward?
- Am I oriented toward what is true, good, and beautiful, or just what I want?
- Is this reality-centric or ego-centric? **Implementation Details:** Frame goals as infinite games (ongoing play) rather than finite games (win/lose). Focus on who you're becoming rather than what you're achieving. Red flag: "My life will be complete when..." Green flag: "This helps me stay oriented toward..." **Source Context:** Vervaeke's critique of standard purpose-driven approaches to meaning.


## **Investment in Loss** - _When deciding whether to engage with difficult challenges_

**Application:** Deliberately enter situations where you'll likely fail initially in order to learn faster. Accept short-term losses for long-term gains. **Decision Criteria:** Ask: "Will avoiding this challenge prevent me from learning something crucial?" "Am I protecting my ego at the expense of growth?" **Implementation Details:** Green flag: Training partners who consistently beat you. Red flag: Always seeking opponents you know you can defeat. Systematically note what causes each loss and work to eliminate those patterns. **Source Context:** Waitzkin's training with Evan, who consistently threw him against walls until he learned to neutralize superior force.

## **The Trigger Override System** 
_When changing habits or automatic behaviors_

**Application:** Don't try to change the behavior directly. Identify the environmental cue that triggers the non-essential behavior and associate that same cue with an essential behavior instead.

**Decision Criteria:**

- What environmental trigger currently prompts this non-essential behavior?
- What essential behavior could I link to this same trigger?
- Can I create a new trigger for the essential behavior?

**Implementation Details:**

- **Steps:** 1) Map the cue-routine-reward loop 2) Keep the cue and reward, change only the routine 3) Practice the new association repeatedly
- **Example:** If seeing phone triggers email checking, use phone sight as trigger to open journal instead
- **Success factors:** Start small, be consistent, use existing strong triggers rather than creating entirely new ones

**Source Context:** Applied to developing routine habits like daily journaling by linking it to existing triggers. Essentialism book

## **The Reverse Pilot** 
_When questioning existing commitments or initiatives_

**Application:** Instead of asking whether to add something, test whether removing an existing activity causes any negative consequences. Quietly eliminate or scale back an activity for a few days/weeks to assess its true value.

**Decision Criteria:**

- "If I didn't already have this commitment, how much would I invest to acquire it?"
- "What would happen if we stopped doing this entirely?"
- Has anyone actually noticed or complained about its absence?

**Implementation Details:**

- **Steps:** 1) Identify candidate for elimination 2) Stop doing it without announcement 3) Wait and observe 4) Measure actual impact vs. assumed impact
- **Green flags:** No one notices, no negative consequences, freed up time enables higher-value work
- **Warning signs:** Emotional attachment to the activity rather than objective value assessment

**Source Context:** Executive who stopped publishing a weekly report that consumed enormous team energy but added no real value. Essentialism book

## **The Deep Work Hypothesis** - _When evaluating career strategy or skill development_

**Application:** Use this to predict which skills and work styles will become most valuable. Deep work ability is becoming simultaneously rarer and more valuable, creating a competitive advantage for those who cultivate it. **Decision Criteria:**

- Is this skill automatable or easily outsourced?
- Does mastering this require sustained, uninterrupted concentration?
- Will this skill differentiate me in an increasingly distracted marketplace? **Implementation Details:** Prioritize developing skills that require deep cognitive effort over those that can be learned through fragmented attention. Look for fields where depth creates exponential rather than linear returns. **Source Context:** Core thesis from Part 1, supported by economic analysis of the "Great Restructuring" So good they cant ignore you c newport

## **The Quality-Leverage Decision Matrix** - _When choosing between competing opportunities_

**Application:** Evaluate opportunities based on both the quality demands they place on you and the leverage they provide for future freedom. Quality work creates options; busy work creates more busy work.

**Decision Criteria:**

- Does this work require/allow me to operate at my highest capability level?
- Will completing this well give me more control over future projects?
- Can I deliver something notably better than the standard expectation?
- Does this build skills that increase my autonomy?

**Implementation Details:**

- **Green Flag:** Projects where you can significantly exceed normal standards
- **Yellow Flag:** Routine work that pays well but doesn't build leverage
- **Red Flag:** High-maintenance, low-skill work that creates dependency
- **Implementation:** Regularly assess whether your current mix builds toward more autonomy

## **Illusion of Competence Detection** 
_When evaluating whether you actually understand material_

**Application:** Use recall testing rather than recognition testing. Look away from material and see what you can reproduce. If you can't recall it without looking, you don't actually know it yet. **Decision Criteria:** Am I confusing familiarity with mastery? Can I reproduce this knowledge without looking at the source? Am I relying too heavily on highlighting or rereading? **Implementation Details:** After studying, close the book and write/say what you remember. Use flashcards and test yourself in different locations. Repeat homework problems until solutions "flow like a song." Red flag: Feeling confident after just reading/highlighting. Green flag: Struggling initially with recall but improving over time. **Source Context:** Her insight that understanding alone isn't enough for mastery, and the distinction between recognition and recall.
