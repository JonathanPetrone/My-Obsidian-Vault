## **Universality Recognition Framework** 
_When trying to determine if insights from one domain apply to another_ 
**Application:** Look for mathematical or structural similarities across seemingly different domains. If you find universal patterns (like period-doubling, scaling relationships, or fractal structures), solutions from one field may transfer to another. **Decision Criteria:** Do these systems share similar mathematical structures? Are there common bifurcation points? Do they exhibit similar scaling behaviors or geometric patterns? **Implementation Details:** Abstract away surface differences to find underlying mathematical relationships. Test whether changing parameters produces similar sequences of behavior changes. Green flag: Finding the same numerical constants or ratios appearing across domains. Red flag: Forcing analogies based on superficial similarities. **Source Context:** Feigenbaum's discovery that the same mathematical constants appeared in completely different physical systems undergoing transitions to chaos.

## **The Trigger Override System** 
_When changing habits or automatic behaviors_

**Application:** Don't try to change the behavior directly. Identify the environmental cue that triggers the non-essential behavior and associate that same cue with an essential behavior instead.

**Decision Criteria:**

- What environmental trigger currently prompts this non-essential behavior?
- What essential behavior could I link to this same trigger?
- Can I create a new trigger for the essential behavior?

**Implementation Details:**

- **Steps:** 1) Map the cue-routine-reward loop 2) Keep the cue and reward, change only the routine 3) Practice the new association repeatedly
- **Example:** If seeing phone triggers email checking, use phone sight as trigger to open journal instead
- **Success factors:** Start small, be consistent, use existing strong triggers rather than creating entirely new ones

**Source Context:** Applied to developing routine habits like daily journaling by linking it to existing triggers. Essentialism book

### The Investment Banking Model to Handle Depression
_When feeling like activities are pointless during depressive episodes_

**Treat experiences as investments in a future emotional state rather than expecting immediate returns.** Bank experiences when you can't feel their value in the moment.

Decision Criteria:
- Will I be able to withdraw emotional value from this later when my mood shifts?
- Am I avoiding this solely because I can't feel good about it right now?
- Does this have potential meaning even if I can't access it currently?

Take photos, engage in activities, maintain relationships even when they feel emotionally flat. Key insight: **"The way something feels while you are doing it is not necessarily the way it's going to feel later."** 

Red flag: Avoiding all potentially meaningful experiences because of current numbness.

### The Progressive Inquiry Model
_When facing problems, opportunities, or the need for innovation_

**Application:** Three-stage questioning framework: Why (step back, understand context), What If (divergent thinking, unusual connections), How (rapid experimentation with prototypes).

**Key Decision Points:**

- **Why:** Are you questioning assumptions rather than accepting "the way things are"?
- **What If:** Are you allowing wide-open thinking and making unexpected connections?
- **How:** Are you starting with imperfect prototypes and learning from failure?

**Green flags:** Questions that challenge conventional wisdom, ideas combining unexpected elements, rapid experimentation **Red flags:** Analysis paralysis, obvious solutions, perfectionism preventing testing **Key practice:** Live with questions rather than rushing to answers
