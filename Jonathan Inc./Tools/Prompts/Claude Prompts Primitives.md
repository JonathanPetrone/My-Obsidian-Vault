### Known topic
Give me the fundamental primitives and their key characteristics for [TOPIC].

Focus on:
- Core tradeoffs/axes that define the design space
- Properties of each primitive (not implementation details)
- How primitives combine to explain real systems

I want the building blocks that let me reason upward, not a survey of specific technologies.



**Alternative (more concise):**

What are the fundamental primitives for [TOPIC] and their characteristics? Give me the minimal concepts I need to reason about the design space.


### Known context

I'm about to read [source/chapter/topic]. Before I dive into details, what are the fundamental primitives and key characteristics I should understand first? Give me the conceptual framework that will help me recognize what matters as I read. ``` **Or more direct:** ``` I'm reading [source] about [topic]. What are the core primitives/axes I should understand before getting into specific implementations?
