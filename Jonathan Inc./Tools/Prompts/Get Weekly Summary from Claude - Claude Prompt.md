# Week of Dec 20-26, 2025

## Work & Career

**Active context:** Test Lead + interim CAB leadership; compensating for Amir's planning chaos; organizational dysfunction

**Key developments:** Big Five results showed maximum Cautiousness (20) + high Immoderation (13) = need extensive deliberation but struggle with rabbit holes. Work difficulties aren't discipline - you're trapped in exploration mode by incomplete info. "Glue person" pattern: compensating for dysfunction vs. building autonomous achievements.

**Questions generated:** What context gives autonomy that makes org dysfunction irrelevant? How to build proof of autonomous delivery?

**Status:** Exploring options / Holiday break before work resumption

## Exploration

**Active domains:** Kastrup's idealist metaphysics, asymmetrical risk/optionality frameworks, iOS development basics, optimizing system instructions for less sycophancy

**Key developments:** Kastrup's filter hypothesis (psychedelics = decreased brain activity), ethical implications of ontological unity, optionality vs. antifragility distinction, framework for measuring optionality through exploration sessions

**Outcomes:** Kastrup reading complete, iOS abandoned without use case, optionality framework built but application deferred

**Status:** Philosophy complete / Technical exploration paused / Optionality deferred

## Personal

**Current context:** Relationship with Bree (long-distance), acute burnout recovery, using Pixels journal for tracking

**Energy/substrate:** 10+ hours sleep nightly, social performance = primary drain, intellectual engagement = restorative. Week and a half into recovery.

**Decisions pending:** Work adjustments when resuming, relationship sustainability clarity

**Status:** Acute burnout recovery / Work resumes soon / Relationship uncertainty

## Deferred Questions

- Can you sustain relationship with Bree? (Can't assess during acute burnout)
- What work adjustments needed? (Need live data from actual resumption)
- What direction to progress toward? (Forcing direction-finding with degraded deliberation capacity)
