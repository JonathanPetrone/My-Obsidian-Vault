#### Foreword and Chapter 1

##### How do we absorb knowledge rather than information?
Since knowledge is more than surface level, we have to work with the information to transform it into knowledge. The information is perhaps absorbed but rather refined to some knowledge. knowledge can't be absorbed but is rather constructed. (My take)

####  Chapter 2
- What senses could I employ more of to explore and learn better?

##### How is my environment affecting my curiousity?
###### Curiosity-Killing Work Environments:
- **Cultures where "not knowing" is seen as weakness** rather than opportunity
- **Excessive focus on short-term results** with no time for exploration
- **Hierarchical structures that discourage questioning** from lower levels
- **Risk-averse cultures** that punish failed experiments
###### Curiosity-Encouraging Work Environments:
- **Leaders who model intellectual humility** and admit uncertainties
- **Time and resources allocated for exploration** and "failed" experiments
- **Cross-functional collaboration** that exposes you to different expertise
- **Celebration of questions and learning** not just answers and knowing

- How can I remind myself to ask questions?

#### Chapter 3
##### Are analogies a tool for us to cultivate curiousity? (linked to D. Berlyne and the concept of knowledge effect and relationship to curiousity)

**Analogies are indeed powerful tools for cultivating curiosity** because they leverage Berlyne's fundamental insight: they position us perfectly in the "knowledge zone" where we know enough to be intrigued but not enough to be satisfied, creating the productive tension that drives sustained intellectual exploration.
