Design your Work - T. Forte + Claude
### How to Apply:
**Phase 1 - Constraint Discovery**
- Identify what you consistently struggle with or what drains energy
- Notice patterns in your peak performance moments
- Document what you naturally gravitate toward vs. avoid
- Test boundaries through deliberate experimentation

**Phase 2 - Constraint Adoption**
- Choose limitations that channel your energy toward strengths
- Eliminate options that historically lead to poor outcomes
- Create "rules" that reduce decision fatigue in low-value areas
- Build systems that make good choices automatic

**Phase 3 - Mastery Through Constraints**
- Operate within your chosen limitations until they become unconscious
- Notice how constraints enable deeper exploration rather than limiting it
- Develop effortless competence within your defined parameters
- Use constraints as launching pads for higher-order capabilities

**Phase 4 - Constraint Evolution**
- Recognize when current constraints become too limiting
- Seek productive tensions that signal need for framework upgrade
- Allow new, more sophisticated constraints to emerge
- Integrate learnings into next-level constraint system
