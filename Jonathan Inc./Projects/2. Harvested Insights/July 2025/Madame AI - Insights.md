### Insights
- Learned that you should have an architectural direction when building, i.e restrictions. Don't let AI generate code that breaks your principles.
- Learned more about simple agents and API calls to OpenAI API. It's a hard and iterative process to get AI output right. Due to the unpredictability of output, AI is often the more reliable cleaner of its own output, rather than building strict cleaning rules yourself.
- You should iteratively always ask about generated code and make an effort to learn what all the parts do.
- AI is very useful in making shell scripts to run parts of your application. It made scripts for switching .envs and deploying my code
- My energy wained when I got to the point of a logged in user, I don't feel there is any learning in creating Tarot content that you can buy, I lack the interest in going deep in Astrology etc.f
- Docker is a very useful tool for development and deploying apps.
- Learned more about using HTMX in designing a web application, also the html/template package in GO.
- Practiced my ability to structure and add features iteratively and also to refactor occasionally.
- Generated images are hard to get right in ChatGPT
- Claude is a better companion for app development in my experience than ChatGPT
- Adding a commands.txt is very useful when working with code, also I split my program in multiple main.go's.
