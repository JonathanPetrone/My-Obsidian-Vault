### P/NP problem distinction
**P Problems**: We have algorithms that **always work** AND are **always fast** (polynomial time)

- Like following a recipe that always works and always takes a reasonable amount of time
- Example: Sorting a list - we have algorithms (like merge sort) that always work and scale predictably

**NP Problems**: We can **always verify** a solution quickly, but we don't know if we can **always find** solutions quickly

- It's not that our methods are "hit or miss" - it's that our **best known methods** might require exponential time in the worst case
- Example: For Sudoku, we have methods that always work, but they might take an extremely long time on hard puzzles**
