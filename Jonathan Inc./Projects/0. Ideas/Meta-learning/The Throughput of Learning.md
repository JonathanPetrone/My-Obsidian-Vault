- Which domains do you avoid testing?
- What emotional triggers indicate threatened assumptions?
- How do you typically respond when proven wrong?

### Build Assumption-Testing Infrastructure
- Create low-friction experimentation systems
- Establish regular "assumption audit" reviews
- Build relationships with people who will challenge you
- Design environments that surface contradictions
