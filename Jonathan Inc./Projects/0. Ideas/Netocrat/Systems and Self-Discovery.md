Netocrat framework through a systems thinking lens, this the HOW and WHAT
### Information Systems Architecture
**Create an "Attentionality Pipeline"**
- Set up automated information feeds using your existing tools (Obsidian + AI) 
- Establish weekly "synthesis sessions" where you generate insights by connecting disparate information sources

**Personal Knowledge Network**
- Document your learning in public (blog, LinkedIn posts, GitHub repos)
- Create templates in Obsidian for capturing and sharing insights from conferences, courses, and experiments
- Build a system for contributing meaningful insights to professional communities

## Network Access Architecture
**Strategic Positioning**
- Map the key networks in your intersection areas: AI + Testing, Go + Architecture, Scandinavian Tech
- Identify the "netocratic nodes" - people who bridge multiple valuable networks in these spaces
- Create value-first connection strategies: solve problems for network members before asking for anything

**Global Mobility Infrastructure**
- Since you're already in Sweden (tech-forward country), leverage this positioning
- Build location-independent income streams using your Go skills and testing expertise
- Create systems that allow you to work from anywhere while maintaining your network connections

## Information Control Systems
**Exclusive Knowledge Creation**
- Develop proprietary frameworks combining your testing background with AI agent development
- Build experimental projects that showcase the intersection of Go, AI, and testing - areas where few people operate

**Strategic Information Sharing**
- Use your detail-oriented nature to create high-quality, unique content that demonstrates deep understanding
- Share frameworks and systems thinking approaches rather than just surface-level tips
- Position yourself as someone who can translate between technical and strategic levels
