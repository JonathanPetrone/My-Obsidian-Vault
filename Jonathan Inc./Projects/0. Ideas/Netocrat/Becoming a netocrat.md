1. **Build up your "attentionality"**
This is the currency of the netocrats. It's not just about consuming information, but actively participating in the information flow. You need to develop your ability to absorb, sort, generate, and share valuable information within the networks you are a part of.

2. **Focus on networks, not individuals**
In the information society, networks govern power structures. Strive to become part of exclusive networks where you can interact with other netocrats and exchange valuable information. Actively engage in these networks and contribute your expertise and insights.

3. **Master the netiquette**
The unwritten rules that govern the world of the netocrats are subtle and difficult to define. But some important principles are openness, generosity, and a willingness to share knowledge. Avoid bragging and self-assertion, these behaviors are reprehensible within netocracy.

4. **Embrace global mobility**
Netocrats are not bound by national borders. They move to where opportunities exist and see themselves as citizens of the world. Be prepared to move to places that offer an attractive lifestyle and a stimulating cultural environment.

5. **Develop a "dividual" identity**
Netocrats embrace a multiple and changing identity. They see themselves as "dividuals," composed of several different personalities and roles. Don't be afraid to explore different aspects of yourself and adapt your identity to the networks you are a part of.

6. **Think beyond traditional morality**
The netocrats have embraced an "affirmative nihilism," which means that they create their own values and are not bound by outdated moral systems. Be prepared to question traditional norms and think independently.

7. **Understand the power of information**
Netocrats realize that information is power. They use their knowledge to navigate the information society and maintain their position of power. Learn to critically examine information and distinguish what is valuable from what is irrelevant.
