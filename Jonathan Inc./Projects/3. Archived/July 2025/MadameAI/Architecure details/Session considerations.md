# Session Management Strategies: The Complete Guide

## 1. Single Session Per User (Most Restrictive)

**How it works:**
- Only one active session allowed per user
- New login automatically invalidates all previous sessions
- User gets logged out from other devices when logging in elsewhere

**Pros:**
- ✅ Maximum security (impossible to have zombie sessions)
- ✅ Simple session tracking and management
- ✅ Clear audit trail (always know where user is logged in)
- ✅ Prevents session hijacking scenarios
- ✅ Lower database load

**Cons:**
- ❌ Poor user experience for multi-device usage
- ❌ Frustrating for users who switch between devices
- ❌ May not fit modern user expectations

**Best for:**
- Banking/financial apps
- Admin panels
- High-security applications
- Single-device workflows

## 2. Limited Multiple Sessions (Balanced Approach)

**How it works:**
- Allow 2-5 concurrent sessions per user
- When limit exceeded, delete oldest sessions (FIFO)
- Track session metadata (device, location, created time)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Reasonable security with usability
- ✅ Supports multi-device usage (phone + laptop)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of old sessions
- ✅ Can provide "active sessions" management to users

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex implementation
- ❌ Requires session limit configuration
- ❌ Users might get logged out unexpectedly

**Best for:**
- Most web applications
- SaaS platforms
- Consumer apps with multi-device usage
- **Recommended for your tarot app**

## 3. Unlimited Sessions (Most Permissive)

**How it works:**
- Users can have unlimited concurrent sessions
- Only expired sessions are cleaned up
- All sessions remain valid until explicitly logged out

**Pros:**
- ✅ Maximum user convenience
- ✅ No unexpected logouts
- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ Works well for shared accounts

**Cons:**
- ❌ Security risk (old sessions never cleaned up)
- ❌ Potential for session hijacking
- ❌ Database bloat over time
- ❌ Hard to track active usage

**Best for:**
- Low-security applications
- Shared family accounts
- Development environments
- **Your current implementation**

## 4. Device-Based Sessions (Modern Approach)

**How it works:**
- One session per device type (mobile, desktop, tablet)
- Track device fingerprints and user agents
- Allow session management dashboard for users

**Pros:**
- ✅ Intuitive for users (matches expectation)
- ✅ Good security/usability balance
- ✅ Users can see and manage their sessions
- ✅ Granular control

**Cons:**
- ❌ Complex device detection
- ❌ Privacy concerns with fingerprinting
- ❌ Requires more database schema
