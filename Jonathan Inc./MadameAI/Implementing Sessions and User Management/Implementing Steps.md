Looking at your authentication setup, you've got solid foundations with your database schema and generated code. Here's how I'd break down the implementation into manageable, sequential steps:

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Foundation) 

1. **Password Security Layer** ✅
    - Create password hashing utilities (bcrypt wrapper functions)✅
    - Define password validation rules and implement validator✅
    - Create secure session ID generation (crypto/rand based)✅
2. **Database Connection Management** ✅
    - Set up connection pooling configuration ✅
    - Create database connection wrapper with timeout handling ✅
    - Implement basic health check for database connectivity✅

Also set up local vs prod database (supabase), env switching script. And made sure fly.io uses the production db when I deploy.

## Phase 2: User Registration Flow

3. **Registration Handler**
    - Create registration form (HTMX-powered) ✅
    - Implement server-side validation (email format, password strength) ✅
    - Build registration endpoint that creates user ✅
    - Add duplicate email handling ✅
4. **Registration UI/UX**
    - Design registration form with Tailwind ✅
    - Implement real-time validation feedback via HTMX ✅
    - Create success/error message displays ✅
	    - Success -> Success message  ✅
	    - Duplicate email -> Try to log in with your email instead ✅


add fields first name last name in db. ✅
## Phase 3: Authentication Flow

5. **Login System**
    - Build login form and handler ✅
    - Implement credential verification logic ✅
    - Create session creation and cookie management ✅
    - Add login attempt tracking/rate limiting
6. **Session Middleware**
    - Create session validation middleware ✅
    - Implement user context injection for handlers✅
    - Build redirect logic for protected routes ✅

## Phase 4: Session Management

7. **Session Lifecycle**
    - Implement session renewal on activity 
    - Create logout functionality (session cleanup) ✅
    - Build session expiration handling ✅
    - Add cleanup job for expired sessions ✅
8. **Security Enhancements**
    - Implement CSRF protection
    - Add secure cookie configuration
    - Create session hijacking prevention measures

## Phase 5: User Experience Features

9. **User Dashboard/Profile**
    - Create protected user area ✅
    - Build profile viewing/editing
    - Implement password change functionality
10. **Advanced Features** (Optional)
    - Password reset via email tokens
    - Email verification on signup
    - Multiple device session management
    - Remember me functionality

## Implementation Order Rationale:

- **Phase 1-2**: Gets basic registration working end-to-end
- **Phase 3**: Enables users to log back in
- **Phase 4**: Makes the system production-ready
- **Phase 5**: Adds user-facing features

Each phase builds on the previous one, allowing you to test functionality incrementally. You could potentially ship after Phase 3 for a basic working system.

## Confidence Assessment:

**Certain about**: Your database schema is well-designed, sqlc setup will handle query generation cleanly, session-based auth is appropriate for your stack

**Inferring**: You'll want standard bcrypt for password hashing, you'll need middleware for route protection, HTMX will handle form interactions smoothly

**Would need verification**: Specific session duration requirements, whether you need email verification, exact password complexity rules, deployment environment constraints

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific phase or discuss particular implementation challenges you're anticipating?
