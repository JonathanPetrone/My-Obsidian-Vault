Building - "the process of creating or developing something"
Adaptive - "having an ability to change to suit changing conditions"
Expertise - "a high level of knowledge or skill"

Adaptive + Expertise = The ability to attain a high level of knowledge or skill in changing conditions

## Expertise Building through Curiosity
Being adaptive means being curious about the new conditions. Curiosity builds with a balance in three areas [[Knowledge, Surprise, Confidence's relation to Curiosity|Knowledge, Surprise, Confidence]], too much or too little stifles curiosity.  The drive to turn information into knowledge (Epistemic curiosity) is a strong contributor in building expertise in any domain.

Knowledge accumulation is exponential if you combine it with curiosity and exploration. [[Current Mental Models & Frameworks#The Matthew Principle|The Matthew Principle]] is true here, the more knowledge you have the more you can easily build. To build more skill and knowledge at the same time the concept of [[Be a Thinkerer|Thinkering]] can be useful as it encourages running experiments against what you know. 

WHY and HOW questions are important for curiosity and expertise building as they encourage exploration and experiments, and also often results in generating new questions which leads to more exploration and so on. In contrast WHAT questions tend to be more close-ended and definitive.

## Tools For Building Adaptive Expertise 
Powerful tools for building expertise are [[Thinking Structures as Tools for Learning|Thinking Structures]] because they helps us with something to hold onto while thinking, learning, acting, and remembering. There are different structures that are effective depending on the job, some are for recall or remembering, some can be used to cultivate exploration and thinking. Examples are heuristics, mnemonics, models, and mind maps etc.

Building a [[Second Brain]] is a way to store store information from diverse sources (text, video, conversations), that might help you synthesize insights across different domains. Using this [[Second Brain]] as a tool to express, synthesize and cultivate knowledge is a way to keep what resonates with you to let it influence the future you and [[Self-expression through writing is a fundamental self-learning tool|Solidifying what you learn.]]  The [[The Process of Information Gathering Effectively|CODE model]] is a useful framework for the process of information gathering. 

## Analyze the Environment for Rapid Expertise Building
The right approach for building expertise depends on the nature of the environment, is the domain/area/problem [[Complicated and Complex Expertise|Complicated or Complex]]? Complicated domains tend to benefit most from deliberate practice, simplest complete system training and drills. Complex domains tend to benefit from varied context exposure, abstract patterns across instances, first principles. 

There is also the dimension of feedback loops, are they fast or slow? This leads us to a model of different domain spaces and their characteristics:

Transfer of Learning wiki:
- Transfer of learning [Transfer of Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_Learning "Transfer of Learning") Can I see if anything relating on how to best transfer skill/learning/knowledge
	- **Core mechanisms:**
	
	- **Abstraction** - Deliberately extracting underlying principles, creating models, finding analogies/metaphors. This builds associations that enable transfer beyond surface similarities.
	- **Varied practice contexts** - Learning in multiple contexts creates more retrieval paths and encourages generalization rather than context-locked knowledge.
	
	**Teaching strategies (Perkins & Salomon):**
	
	_Hugging_ - Make learning environment similar to application context. Methods: simulation games, mental practice, contingency learning. (Basically: practice in realistic conditions)
	
	_Bridging_ - Explicitly connect learning to other domains. Methods: brainstorming connections, developing analogies, metacognitive reflection. (Basically: force pattern extraction)

### Anders Ericsson
**Core:** Deliberate practice ≠ experience. Requires: specific goal, focused attention, feedback, discomfort zone. 10,000 hour rule is misinterpretation - quality >> quantity.

**Key mechanic:** Mental representations - experts see patterns novices can't. Build these through struggle with slightly-too-hard problems, not comfortable repetition.

**Ericsson's requirements for adaptive expertise:**

1. **Deliberate practice in controlled environments** (not just experience accumulation)
2. **Deep conceptual understanding** (not just procedural knowledge)
3. **Continued cognitive engagement** (resist premature automation)
4. **Metacognitive monitoring** (self-assessment and adjustment)

### Barbara Oakley
**Core:** Diffuse/focused mode alternation for learning. Chunking - build conceptual units through practice, then combine. Illusion of competence from passive review.

**Key mechanic:** Recall > recognition. Interleaving > blocking. Sleep consolidates. Procrastination is habit, not character - change cue response.
