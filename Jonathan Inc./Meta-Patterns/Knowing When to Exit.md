1. **Operational dishonesty ceiling**
	Can't fix paradigm-level dishonesty from your position, i.e a corrupted/shallow/dissonant WHY
2. **Meadows Leverage Hierarchy Position**
	Parameters & Physical Structures → Information Flows → Rules/Power → [Paradigm Ceiling]
3. **Skewed Integrity Cost vs. Value Equation**
	- Learning value: Low (pattern already extracted, just executing known moves)
	- Financial value: High (stable income, runway building)
	- Integrity cost: Moderate but stable (you've built coping mechanisms)
4. **Energy Sustainability Signals**
	Red flags:
	- Energy declining despite coping mechanisms (burnout worsening)
	- Integrity cost increasing (values misalignment harder to tolerate)
	- Resentment building toward Alektum work (even minimal effort feels wrong)
	- Health impacts (sleep worse, stress higher, recovery inadequate)
	- Experiments languishing (not doing validation work, just maintaining Alektum)
	Green flags:
	- Energy stable with current allocation (40-50% Alektum manageable)
	- Experiments progressing (consulting outreach happening, Aperture shipping)
	- Financial runway building (savings on track)
	- CAB transition on track (Gabi onboarding smoothly)
	- No better opportunity emerged (staying is strategic, not avoiding)
5. **New Opportunity Appear**
	New opportunity appears and will be a healthy challenge.
