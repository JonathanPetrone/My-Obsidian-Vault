### Phase 1: Asymmetric Risk Assessment

Downside Ceiling (Must be LOW):

| Criterion              | Red Flag                                 | Green Light                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Time commitment**    | >3 years to viability                    | 2-3 year natural cycle       |
| **Skill lock-in**      | Domain-specific only                     | Transferable patterns        |
| **Exit cost**          | Reputation damage if you leave           | Clean handoff possible       |
| **Energy drain**       | Violates WFH/boundaries                  | Fits current energy budget   |
| **Political exposure** | Success requires organizational politics | Technical/systematic problem |

Upside Multiplier (Must be HIGH):

| Criterion                      | Linear Return             | Multiplicative Return          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Skill compounding**          | Narrow expertise          | Meta-competence growth         |
| **Network effects**            | Isolated work             | Builds reputation/referrals    |
| **Infrastructure persistence** | Disappears when you leave | Outlives your involvement      |
| **Market timing**              | Mature/competitive        | Early/underserved              |
| **Influence trajectory**       | Lateral role              | Increases autonomy/positioning |

### Phase 2: Niche Viability Check
**The Four Questions (Borrowed from your actual pattern):**

1. Is the chaos convertible or systemic?
	- **Convertible:** Technical problem, willing adopters, measurable outcomes
	- **Systemic:** Organizational dysfunction, political resistance, vague success criteria
	- **Your rule:** Only touch convertible chaos

2. Does systematization increase or decrease your autonomy?
	- **Increases:** You build the system, define the process, control documentation
	- **Decreases:** You become maintainer, political gatekeeper, or support role
	- **Your rule:** Only build systems that free you from operational involvement

3. Are there willing adopters or resistant gatekeepers?
	- **Adopters:** People actively want the order you're building (1177 users, CAB stakeholders)
	- **Gatekeepers:** People benefit from chaos and resist systematization (Nova at Alektum)
	- **Your rule:** Need adopters, not just problems

4. Will this build portable or domain-locked expertise?
	- **Portable:** Change management, documentation, technical accessibility, systematization itself
	- **Domain-locked:** Nova's specific data model, Alektum's debt collection rules
	- **Your rule:** Avoid deep domain knowledge that doesn't transfer

### Phase 3: Opportunity Window Assessment
%% This seems not so clear, how can I measure? Investigate for resources with answers to this.%%
Timing Indicators:

| Too Early                    | Sweet Spot                      | Too Late                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Problem not recognized       | Problem known, solution unclear | Solution commoditized     |
| No budget/urgency            | Active pain, willing to pay     | Competitive market        |
| You'd need to educate market | Market is learning, needs guide | Specialists already exist |

### Phase 4: Resource/Leverage Evaluation
What resources do you HAVE that create advantage?

| Resource Type               | Your Current Assets                           | Leverage Potential          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Technical skill**         | Go, accessibility, testing, documentation     | Medium (common skills)      |
| **Meta-competence**         | Pattern extraction, rapid domain entry        | HIGH (rare capability)      |
| **Organizational position** | CAB leader, Peter Wallman visibility          | Medium (time-limited)       |
| **Energy budget**           | 2 WFH days protected                          | Medium (constraint + asset) |
| **Network**                 | Limited (deliberate choice)                   | Low (not optimized)         |
| **Portfolio**               | Aperture (in progress), tarot app (abandoned) | Low (needs shipping)        |
|                             |                                               |                             |

# Decision Matrix Template

**For any opportunity (internal role, consulting project, product idea):**

### Quick Filter (5 minutes):
1. **Downside capped?** (Can I exit in 2-3 years without damage?)
2. **Upside multiplicative?** (Will this make next move easier/better?)
3. **Chaos convertible?** (Technical problem, not political?)
4. **Adopters exist?** (Someone wants this order?)

If ANY answer is "no" → Reject immediately.

---

### Deep Evaluation (30 minutes):

**Score 1-5 on each dimension:**

**Risk Management:**
- Time commitment fits natural cycle? (1=5+ years, 5=2-3 years)
- Skill portability? (1=domain-locked, 5=pure meta-competence)
- Exit cleanliness? (1=bridges burned, 5=grateful handoff)
- Energy sustainability? (1=violates boundaries, 5=fits WFH budget)

**Leverage Building:**
- Meta-competence growth? (1=narrow skill, 5=transferable pattern)
- Reputation compound? (1=invisible work, 5=portfolio-worthy)
- Network effects? (1=isolated, 5=referral engine)
- Market timing? (1=commodity, 5=early/underserved)

**Execution Clarity:**
- Adopter willingness? (1=resistance, 5=active demand)
- Success measurability? (1=vague, 5=concrete metrics)
- Autonomy trajectory? (1=becomes maintenance, 5=builds freedom)
- Infrastructure persistence? (1=dies when you leave, 5=self-sustaining)

**Minimum viable score: 40/60 (average 3.3/5)**

Anything below 40 → High risk of regret

### Resources for Niche Identification:

**Books/Essays:**

1. **Patrick McKenzie's essays** (patio11's blog) - Best real-world examples of niche identification → systematization → exit
2. **"Blue Ocean Strategy"** (Kim & Mauborgne) - Framework for finding underserved markets (though corporate-oriented)
3. **"The Mom Test"** (Rob Fitzpatrick) - How to validate if a niche actually wants your solution (customer development)
4. **"Obviously Awesome"** (April Dunford) - Positioning in underserved niches (once you've chosen one)
5. **Paul Graham's essays** - Particularly "Do Things That Don't Scale" and "Schlep Blindness" (seeing opportunities others miss)


Practical Tools:
1. **Trends.vc / Product Hunt** - See what problems people are actively trying to solve
2. **Hacker News "Ask HN"** - Unfiltered problems from technical audience
3. **r/entrepreneur "Idea Validation"** - What problems frustrate people enough to post publicly
4. **LinkedIn job postings** - What roles are companies struggling to fill? (Signals underserved niches)
5. **Your own "friction log"** - Document every time you think "why doesn't X exist?" or "why is Y so broken?"


Your actual best resource:
**Conversations with people in adjacent roles** (not competitors, but tangent domains):

- What problems do THEY wish someone would systematize?
- What chaos do THEY see but lack time/skill to fix?
- What would THEY pay for if it existed?
