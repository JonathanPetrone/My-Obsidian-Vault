## Instances:
- **Accessibility at 1177 (2019-2021)**: Junior with no credentials, created demand for expertise no one knew they needed
- **Testing instruction (2021-2023)**: Teaching testing just 2 years after graduating, had to establish authority quickly
- **Alektum Process and CAB leadership (2024-present)**: Interim role during chaos, building credibility while navigating layoffs

## Invariant structure:
1. Find problem others avoid (low competition, high pain)
2. Deliver small win to one stakeholder (proof of concept)
3. Document/systematize approach (makes it teachable = scalable)
4. Teach others (positions you as expert, not just doer)
5. Expand scope through teaching network (they advocate for you)

## Boundary conditions:
- **Works when:** 
  - Problem is actually painful (not just "nice to have")
  - At least one ally with budget/authority exists
  - You can deliver visible small win quickly (2-4 weeks)
  - Organization values systematization over hero culture
  
- **Fails when:**
  - Problem is political hot potato (people want it to fail)
  - No one has authority to implement solutions
  - You try to scale before proving small
  - Organization rewards individual heroics over systems

## Transferability score: High
Applied successfully across 3 different domains, 3 different organizational contexts (healthcare, education, tech consulting), different seniority levels. The pattern works regardless of technical domain.

## What this taught me:
- Credibility comes from **making others successful**, not from credentials
- Documentation is a credibility multiplier (one success → many successes)
- Teaching is the fastest path to authority (you position yourself above students)
- Small wins matter more than big promises (proof > potential)
- The pattern accelerates: each success makes next application faster because reputation precedes you
  
**Pattern is now instant-recognition**: When I see chaos + no owner, I know exactly what to do
