## Work & Career

**Active context:** Test Lead at Alektum with interim CAB leadership. No assigned tasks - must generate own work to appear productive (~50% actual work hours). Survived three layoffs. Manager Amir creates planning chaos; colleague Markus was creating surveillance stress (resolved via private office). Alexandra mentioned as proactive colleague.

**Key developments:**
- Secured private office, eliminating core surveillance stressor from Markus watching screen
- Recognized pattern as "defensive optimization" - building shock absorbers (change management templates, task templates, documentation) that help teams operate despite organizational chaos
- Created organizational infrastructure but lacks proper recognition/authority
- Identified interest in positioning this systems work externally through consulting, content, or productization for proper credit

**Questions generated:**
- How to properly position infrastructure/systems work for recognition and authority
- Whether current role is sustainable 18-24 months as paid learning sabbatical if boundaries maintained
- Which technical domains provide better information-completeness match for career transition

**Status:** On holiday break for burnout recovery. Role appears tenable short-term if documentation boundaries hold and private office maintains reduced surveillance stress. Infrastructure work pattern identified but external positioning unexplored.

## Exploration

**Active domains:**

- **Philosophy:** Bernardo Kastrup's idealism, filter hypothesis, natural theology
- **Personality psychology:** Big Five test results analysis and work implications
- **Career optionality:** Asymmetric risk frameworks, exploration sessions as measurement
- **iOS/macOS development:** Screen saver app capabilities investigation
- **Knowledge management:** Framework integration methods, epistemology note refinement
- **Personal development:** Mental model practice structure, aesthetic preferences

**Key developments:**

- Big Five results revealed max Cautiousness (20) + high Immoderation (13) = needs extensive deliberation before committing but struggles with intellectual rabbit holes. Work completion struggles aren't discipline issues but information-completeness mismatches
- Recognized Kastrup's filter hypothesis (psychedelics reduce brain activity while intensifying experience) as empirical support for idealist metaphysics
- Developed naturalistic ethics argument: if consciousness manifesting through living beings is universal mind's nature, facilitating this aligns with inherent purpose
- Proposed exploration sessions as concrete measurement for 2026 optionality goal
- Identified missing Stoic dichotomy of control framework for operating within constraining systems
- Explored art preferences: darker symbolic compression, purposeful imagery, transformation themes

**Outcomes:**

- iOS development exploration closed without compelling use case
- Two Modes of Epistemic Knowing note refined (rules-based vs pattern-based knowing)
- Kastrup reading progressed through chapter 4; determined chapters 5 and 8 worth continued engagement
- System instructions optimized to reduce sycophancy, increase intellectual friction

**Status:** Philosophy exploration active but execution deferred until substrate recovers. Recognized trying to force direction-finding while in degraded deliberation state.

## Personal

**Current context:** Long-distance relationship with Bree; dog Bella; improving physical environment including office chair shopping; private office secured at work.

**Energy/substrate:** Acute burnout recovery with 10+ hour sleep needs. Minimal energy beyond low-stakes engagement (YouTube, gaming). Using Pixels journal to track dominant weekly feelings as recovery monitoring system.

**Decisions pending:**

- Work adjustment specifics (deferred until return from break with live data)
- Relationship evaluation (intellectual incompatibility acknowledged but active decision deferred)
- Career direction (recognized need for recovered substrate before assessment)

**Status:** Recovery phase with reduced deliberation capacity. Private office eliminates surveillance stress. Weekly summary system paired with Pixels journal implemented for tracking without cognitive overload.

## Deferred Questions

- How to properly position infrastructure/systems work for recognition and authority (consulting, content, productization pathways unexplored)
- Which technical domains provide information-completeness match for max Cautiousness + high Immoderation profile
- Exploration sessions implementation: time-boxed blocks vs question-driven vs domain sampling
- Mental model practice structure for building recognition patterns
- Relationship decision framework (deferred until recovered substrate allows accurate assessment)
- Work adjustment specifics (deferred until return from holiday break with live data)
