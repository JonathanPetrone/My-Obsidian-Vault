# Week of Dec 29, 2025 - Jan 4, 2026

## Work & Career

**Active context:** Test Lead at Alektum with interim CAB responsibilities; survived multiple layoffs by being embedded in dependency structures; considering Change Manager maternity cover role but recognizing authority mismatch; works in restricted environment requiring approvals for database queries, server access, script execution

**Key developments:** Career pattern identified as "serial systematizer" - enters chaotic environments, builds infrastructure/documentation, gains influence through systems, moves on in 2-3 year cycles. Not a deep domain specialist but develops "meta-competence" - rapidly building expertise in new domains by extracting transferable patterns. Work restrictions fundamentally limit terminal skills value proposition since operational agency doesn't exist. Set up Azure DevOps → Teams push notifications after troubleshooting multiple technical challenges.

**Questions generated:** What's actual exit criteria for Alektum - "CAB self-sustaining" or "maximum learning extracted"? How to build proof of autonomous delivery vs. compensating for organizational dysfunction? What specific programming capabilities to develop when current role offers limited direct coding opportunities?

**Status:** Extracting career meta-patterns / Building systems outside work constraints / Considering positioning for institutional change rather than stability

## Exploration

**Active domains:**

- **Aperture project:** RSS aggregation system (Go/HTMX/SQLite/Tailwind) for content curation with AI digests, accept/reject feedback loop, integration with Obsidian vault context
- **Knowledge systems:** Optimized book extraction workflow, building meta-pattern templates for career experiences, reformatting frameworks to personal style
- **Big Five application:** High Openness + high Conscientiousness tension - need for extensive deliberation before commitment but struggle with intellectual rabbit holes; high Immoderation creates completion challenges
- **Institutional change theory:** Fourth Turning cyclical history (Neil Howe), institutional dysfunction (Eric Weinstein), liberal authority mismatches (Philip Pilkington), systems theory (Ashby, Bertalanffy, Gall)
- **Technical learning:** HTMX mechanics clarification, Go package naming (store vs. db), SQLite tooling (DB Browser), keyboard remapping (VIA/QMK), Gmail filtering optimization

**Key developments:**

- Aperture evolved from vague "information dashboard" to concrete design: phased MVP (UI with mocks → backend core → LLM integration → feedback loop), visual design extracted from lagoon mountains image
- Discovered knowledge work is about extracting meta-patterns that compound across specializations, not philosophical synthesis - redesigned approach around three tiers: meta-patterns (highest value), domain patterns (contextual heuristics), domain knowledge (reference)
- Refined book extraction workflow: tag extracts during capture vs. immediate shortening, diagnostic questions when novelty fades, compress after full context within tag groups
- Big Five traits revealed completion pattern requiring: adequate exploration phase, concrete observable impact, novelty through implementation, clear success criteria, safe feedback context
- Recognized Conscientiousness creates filtering issue where ideas get pre-rejected as "not important enough" before exploration begins
- Terminal skills deemed counterproductive for current work (access restrictions), asymmetric optionality only if building toward autonomous work environments

**Outcomes:**

- Aperture: Clear direction established but implementation deferred to fresh session
- HTMX: Comprehensive reference guide created with corrected request flow mechanics
- Book workflow: Reduced cognitive overhead while preserving bottom-up pattern discovery
- Gmail: Multiple filters implemented reactively, avoiding "perfection theater" trap
- Teams notifications: Working solution with formatted messages displaying pusher/commit details
- Various technical explorations completed: keyboard mapping fixed via VIA, RSS feeds researched but minimal subscription approach, DB Browser installed for SQLite viewing

**Status per domain:**

- Aperture: Design complete / Implementation pending
- Knowledge systems: Active refinement / Meta-pattern extraction ongoing
- Big Five application: Framework internalized / Behavioral calibration in progress
- Institutional theory: Reading list generated (Pilkington, Howe, Weinstein) / Exploration phase
- Technical skills: Reactive learning as friction emerges / No systematic capability-building yet

## Personal

**Current context:** Long-distance relationship with Bree (Philippines), living in Sweden with dog Bella; analyzing cohabitation dynamics via Big Five differences - Bree's higher neuroticism/excitement-seeking vs. Jonathan's stability/cautiousness, Bree's practical orientation vs. Jonathan's maximum intellect score creating abstract discussion needs

**Energy/substrate:** Recovering from acute burnout requiring 10+ hours sleep nightly. Intellectual engagement = restorative; social performance = draining. High Openness exhausts creative meaning quickly, requiring experiential/attitudinal meaning construction (Frankl framework). Moderate Neuroticism needs pre-defined "unavoidable suffering" to avoid escape rationalization.

**Decisions pending:**

- Relationship sustainability with Bree (can't assess during burnout recovery)
- Work adjustments when resuming (need live data from actual resumption)
- Whether to develop autonomous coding capabilities without clear problem to solve
- Exit timing from Alektum - distinguishing "system complete" from "organization still dysfunctional"

**Status:** Burnout recovery ongoing / Relationship compatibility analyzed but deferred / Building systems thinking frameworks / Questioning dependency-based survival strategy

## Deferred Questions

- Can you sustain relationship with Bree? (Compatibility analyzed via Big Five but sustainability requires post-recovery assessment)
- What work adjustments needed when resuming? (Theoretical analysis complete, need empirical data)
- Should you learn NeoVim/terminal skills? (Evaluated as counterproductive for current restricted work environment, asymmetric optionality only if moving toward autonomous roles)
- What programming capabilities to build? (Struggling with "not important enough" filtering before exploration begins; need Phase 1 Openness-dominant exploration without Conscientiousness pre-rejection)
- What's the actual problem Aperture solves? (Design complete but unclear if information overload is real constraint vs. system tidiness preference)
- When to exit Alektum? (CAB self-sustaining vs. maximum learning extracted - criteria not yet defined)
- How to position for institutional change vs. institutional stability? (Theory explored but concrete positioning strategy undefined)
