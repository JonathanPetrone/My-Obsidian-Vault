# Week of January 5-11, 2026

## Work & Career

**Active context:** Test Lead + CAB leader at Alektum (debt collection); moved to advisory role with Amir's team while CAB operates as separate domain with more autonomy. Building visibility with Peter Wallman (Head of IT) ahead of restructure expected 6-12 months out when Alektum rebrands to bank. Gabi returns December 2026.

**Key developments:** Discovered Gervais Principle framework perfectly names existing pattern: operating as "conscious Loser with Sociopath awareness" - sees organizational dysfunction clearly but refuses to purely optimize for extraction. This creates "integrity ceiling" pattern. Fundamental tension identified: doing Sociopath navigation with Loser values is unsustainable. Change management work continues (UPS maintenance categorization), demonstrating competence but not addressing core need for paradigm authority.

**Questions generated:** Is building visibility with Peter sufficient for paradigm-level role? Can position authority satisfy better than earned authority through output? What's the actual leverage mechanism - waiting for org restructure vs building external proof?

**Status:** Strategic waiting position / Maintaining 50-75% effort across Nova + CAB / Protecting 2 WFH days

## Exploration

**Active domains:**

- _Organizational dynamics:_ Venkatesh Rao's "Tempo" and "Be Slightly Evil" frameworks, Gervais Principle application
- _Web architecture:_ Hypermedia-driven applications, understanding SPA vs MPA trade-offs, evaluating patterns for Aperture
- _Career frameworks:_ Adaptive expertise building, systematization consulting positioning, three-path analysis (consulting/product/employment)
- _Go programming:_ Weekend coding motivation problem surfaced

**Key developments:** Identified core meta-pattern as "serial systematizer" - 2-3 year cycles entering chaos, building infrastructure, exiting when maintenance-oriented. "Competence kills curiosity" pattern clarified: solving conceptual challenge kills execution interest (demonstrated via sudoku example). Tempo framework revealed why programming frustrates: trying to force momentum structure onto inherently tempo work. Big Five results (max Cautiousness + high Immoderation) explains need for extensive deliberation but susceptibility to intellectual rabbit holes.

**Outcomes:**

- Organizational frameworks: Successfully applied to Alektum situation, provided language for integrity ceiling pattern
- Web architecture: Achieved conceptual clarity on server/client/mixed approaches, ready to evaluate for Aperture implementation
- Weekend coding: Framework failure - doesn't solve actual problem (wanting authority without earning through output)
- Stoicism: Requested Enchiridion for handling waiting-period discomfort

**Status:** Frameworks successfully synthesized / Technical architecture options mapped / Motivation pattern diagnosed but unsolved / Philosophical resources identified

## Personal

**Current context:** Long-distance relationship with Bree (Philippines); dog Bella; has office at work; 2-3 WFH days weekly. Brother gift-giving situation explored (gaming/hand issues context).

**Energy/substrate:** Conflict avoidance + over-responsibility pattern identified through madameai.app customer service anxiety. Prefers reflective friction through dialogue over solo reflection or external social pressure. High conscientiousness creates trap: wants systematic mastery before doing, but programming is use-dependent and crystallizes through friction.

**Decisions pending:** Whether position authority (waiting for restructure) or earned authority (weekend building) is viable path to paradigm control. How to handle discomfort of strategic waiting when drive system wants immediate capability demonstration.

**Status:** Substrate stable / Career positioning in holding pattern / Philosophical resources sought for patience cultivation

## Deferred Questions

- Can you actually ship products given "competence kills curiosity" pattern? (Tarot app precedent suggests no, but Aperture could test "paying customers as motivation" hypothesis)
- Does building visibility artifacts from teaching materials actually create organizational authority? (Already tested negative via immediate disinterest)
- Is December 2026 timeline with Gabi's return the actual forcing function or just convenient narrative?
- What specifically would a "paradigm-level role" look like that isn't just more sophisticated coordination work?
- If weekend coding can't accelerate career positioning, what's its actual function - skill maintenance, exploration, or psychological need for progress sensation?
