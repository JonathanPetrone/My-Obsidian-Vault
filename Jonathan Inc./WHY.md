**I want to become exceptionally capable at things I find meaningful, which gives me autonomy and allows me to contribute value to others.**

Meaning:
Complex systems with emergent possibilities where mastery creates unique advantages

## What Makes Something Meaningful to You:

**1. Sufficient Complexity**

- Must have enough depth that mastery takes real effort
- Simple problems bore you; you need systems with multiple interacting parts

**2. Underexplored Territory**
- Things others have dismissed or haven't fully figured out
- Opportunity to discover non-obvious connections or strategies

**3. Emergent Possibilities**

- The deeper you go, the more possibilities reveal themselves
- Systems where expertise unlocks new ways of thinking/acting

**4. Demonstrable Mastery**

- Clear ways to show you understand something others don't
- Ability to teach or share your discoveries with others

## Finding Your Next Meaningful Domain:

**Look for intersections that are:**

- Complex enough to reward deep study
- Undervalued or overlooked by mainstream
- Have emergent properties (the more you learn, the more possibilities open)
- Allow you to develop unique expertise others will value
