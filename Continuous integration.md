Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. 

It’s a DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run. Automated tools are used to assert the new code’s correctness before integration.

CI is generally used alongside an agile software development workflow. An organization will compile list of tasks that comprise a product roadmap. Using CI enables software development tasks to be developed independently and in parallel amongst the assigned developers. Once one of these tasks is complete, a developer will introduce that new work to the CI system to be integrated with the rest of the project.
