If we trace the meaning of religion as a concept back in time we find that it is something that helps binds people together. Religion is thus a social practice created to form bonds between people and create communities or a sense of belonging.

It doesn’t have to relate to belief in higher beings, like gods. It is important to note according to the whole point of religion is to create loyalty and togetherness in a dynamic collective and still feel and act religiously to this day.
