An abstract class is a class that can't be instantiated and is intended to be used as a base class. They are abstract because they don't provide and implementation. An abstract class are typically used to define a common interface or set of behaviors for a child class, who in turn provides the implementation.

An abstract class requires you to inherit from that abstract class and, by extension, all of its potential parents. Although Java, Objective-C, Swift, and .NET classes can inherit from only one parent class, they can implement many interfaces. 

Interfaces are a useful tool in object-oriented programming, as they allow you to define a common set of behaviors that can be shared by multiple types. By implementing an interface, a class or struct can guarantee that it implements a certain set of behaviors, which can make it easier to use and interact with other components in your code.

An abstract class can provide both abstract and concrete methods, whereas an interface provides only abstract methods.
