**1. Perform proper analysis**
	- In the analysis phase, the users and the developers must do the proper research and analysis to determine:
		- the statement of work
		- the requirements of the project
		- ...and whether to actually do the project.
		- Assuming that the project is viable, the primary focus of the analysis phase is for everyone to learn the systems (both the old and the proposed new one) and determine the system requirements.
		
**2. Develop a statement of work**
	- The _statement of work_ (SOW) is a document that describes the system, The SOW should give anyone who reads it a complete, high level understanding of the system. Regardless of how it is written, the SOW must represent the complete system and be clear about how the system will look and feel.
	
**3. Gather the requirements**, (todo: [[Requirements in Product Development]])
	- The _requirements document_ describes what the users want the system to do. Even though the level of detail of the requirements document does not need to be of a highly technical nature, the requirements must be specific enough to represent the user’s needs for the end product. The requirements document can help describe completeness of the system. The requirements are the final representation of the system that must be implemented. All future documents in the software development process will be based on the requirements.
	
**4. Develop a system prototype**
	- A prototype can be just about anything; however, most people consider the prototype to be a simulated user interface. However, in some basic cases, drawing the screens on a whiteboard or even on paper might be all that is needed.
	
**5. Identify the classes**
	- From the requirements, one straightforward way of identifying classes is to highlight all the nouns. These tend to represent objects, such as people, places, and things. As in other forms of brainstorming, get something down initially, with the understanding that the final result might look nothing like the initial pass.
	
**6. Determine the responsibilities of each class**
	- You need to determine the responsibilities of each class you have identified. This includes the data that the class must store and what operations the class must perform
	
**7. Determine how the classes collaborate with each other**
	- This is where the messages between different classes apply. Read more: [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)]]
	
**8. Create a class model to describe the system**
	- The class model shows how the various classes interact within the system. Several tools on the market use UML and provide a good environment for creating and maintaining UML class models.
	
**9. Prototype the user interface in code**
	- During the design process, we must create a prototype of our user interface.
