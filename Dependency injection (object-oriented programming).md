Dependency injection decouples your classâ€™s construction from the construction of its dependencies. So rather than creating objects inside of objects we will inject objects from the outside via the parameter list. 

Interfaces can help us with this, so think Object X implements Y. (see: [[Classes (object-oriented programming)]])

We can inject via the constructor or by a setter.

In general want to avoid dependencies and highly coupled classes (classes dependent on each other).

Both inheritance and aggregation by composition (embeddding all components in a single unit) can create highly coupled classes.
