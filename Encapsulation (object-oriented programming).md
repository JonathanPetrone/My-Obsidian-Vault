Encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, like a class. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state of an object from the outside. This is calledÂ data or information hiding. Depending on the methods that you implement, you can decide if an attribute can be read and changed. You may also control if the attribute is read-only or not visible at all.

The main benefits of encapsulation is that it allows you to hide specific information and also control access to the internal state of objects. You can handle the access to objects with "**Getters** (accessor methods) and **Setters** (mutator methods)" which provide controlled access to an object's data.
