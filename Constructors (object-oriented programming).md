Constructors are special methods that are used to create objects from classes. In some programming languages they have the same name as the class they are built for.

When you create an object the constructor of the class is called, and passing any arguments in the parameter list. With this you can set a certain state of the object you create, passing in data to it.

In Java, C# and C++ a constructor does not have a return value. If a return value is provided the compiler will not treat the method as a constructor.

A general rule is to always provide a constructor in your class, but you don't have to, and if you don't the compiler will provide a default one.
