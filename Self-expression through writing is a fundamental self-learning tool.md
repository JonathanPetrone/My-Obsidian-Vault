When we write we cultivate our thinking and understanding. It's fundamental to express our understanding in our own words if we want to become more competent and grow our understanding on a certain topic. If we have trouble writing about what've "learned", we probably lack understanding parts of it on some level.

When we write we also generate questions, this presents us with next steps and follow up questions which can guide us to logical next steps on our learning journey.
