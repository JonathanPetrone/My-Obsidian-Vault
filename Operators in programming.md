An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.

There are different kinds of operators in programming:

- **Arithmetic operators,** for an example:
	- +
	- -
	- *
	- /
	- %

- **Relational operators**, for an example:
	- ==
	- !=
	- >
	- <
	- >= 
	- <=

- **Logical operators**, for an example:
	- &&
	- ||
	- !
