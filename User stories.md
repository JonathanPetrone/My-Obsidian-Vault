A user story can be said to be â€œan informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of an end user. This is meant to highlight how the software feature in question will generate value for a customer/user."

User stories are a few sentences in simple language that outline the desired outcome. They don't go into detail about implementaton or other circumstances.

A key component of agile software development is said to be putting people first, and a user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework.
