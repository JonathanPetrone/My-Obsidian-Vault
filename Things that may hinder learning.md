Jim Kwik relates to the formula of the Golden Circle by Simon Sinek.

**WHAT:
- A limit in your Mindset : deeply held beliefs, attitudes, and assumptions we create about is possible. For example you entertain a low belief in yourself, your capabilities, what you deserve, or what is possible. 

**HOW:
- A limit in your Method (the HOW): a specific process for accomplishing something, especially an orderly, logical, or systematic way of instruction. For example you were taught and are acting on a process that is not effective to create the results you desire. 

**WHY:
- A limit in your Motivation (the WHY): the purpose one has for taking action. The energy required for someone to behave in a particular way. For example you lack the drive, purpose, or energy to take action.
