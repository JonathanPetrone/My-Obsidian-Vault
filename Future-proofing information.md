To be able to make use of information we value, we need a way to package it up and send it through time to our future self. This is investing in the our future self. We will then have access to the wisdom we picked up earlier when we need to make good decisions or take effective action.

One way to do this is with building a Second Brain, which becomes your knowledge base with future-proofed information.

We are more likely to remember information we've written down in our own words. This comes down to the "Generation Effect", researchers have found that when people actively generate a series of words, such as by speaking or writing, more parts of their brain are activated when compared to simply reading the same words. Writing ideas down is a way of rehearsing those ideas, which makes them far more likely to stick.
