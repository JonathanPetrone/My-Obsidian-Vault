Top down approach starts with the big picture, then breaks down from there into smaller segments. A top-down approach is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion. 

In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements.
