An object can be defined as "a person or a thing to which a specified action or feeling is directed." ([[Object]])

Objects in OOP are defined by:

- **Attributes**, which is data stored in an object which represents the state of the object.
- **Behavior**, represents what the object can do, in OOP called methods.

When an object is created, we say that the objects are *instantiated*. But in OOP an object cannot be instantiated without a class.

### Communication between Objects
Objects communicates through messages between each other. This is their communication mechanism. 

Lets say **Object A** invokes a method of **Object B**, Object A is then sending a message to Object B. Object Bâ€™s response to the message is defined by its return value.
