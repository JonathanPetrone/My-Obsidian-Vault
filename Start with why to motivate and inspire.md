Simon Sinek talks about and tries to capture the thing inherent in purpose, cause and belief helds by a person or group of people in his concept of the "WHY". He uses his concept of the WHY in his model of what he calls the Golden Circle (which has thre parts to it WHY, HOW, WHAT) to capture this alternate view of underlying motivations which results in different outcomes for a person or group of people, by starting or communicating from their WHY.

By leaning on your WHY in communication and in different actions you take you have a bigger chance to inspire others.
