*"To understand something without talking about it, we need to be aware of the details of that thing. But if we focus too much on the details, we lose sight of the bigger picture. This is also true for a comprehensive entity, like a game of chess. The game is controlled by certain principles that depend on following the rules of chess, but these principles cannot be explained just by the rules themselves. Understanding something without talking about it, and the thing itself, are like two levels of reality, each with its own principles. The higher level relies on the lower level, but cannot be fully explained by it."*

We thus need to see the details of the parts as well as the system and overlapping systems which form the whole that we observe.

An example of this is when you analyze a text very closely and break it down into smaller parts this in turn can help you understand it better. But this intense examination can also make it difficult to appreciate the text as a whole.
