## Structure
- **A good structure enables flow**
- **A clear structure or restriction bolster creativity.**
- **The biggest threats to creativity and progress is a lack of structure and restrictions.**
-  **If you managed to structure your workflow according to the fact that writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about**
- **We should strategically build up new habits that have a chance to replace the old ones, not using extensive force to get there immediately.**

## Work flow
- **A smart working environment can help us avoid resistance**
- **Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward**
- **We need to try to structure our workflow in a way so that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward**

## Starting and preconception
- **Everything we do start from an already existing preconception of some sort, which we than can transform.**
- **Good readers can spot limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text.**
- **To really understand a text is a constant revision of our first interpretation**

## Writing and thinking
- **Writing is the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down**
- **If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words.**
- **The ability to express understanding in one’s own words is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes – and only by doing it with the chance of realizing our lack of understanding can we become better at it.**
- **When we write we generate questions, this presents us with next steps and follow up questions, we don’t have to “find a topic” to write about.**

## Attention
- **Different tasks, require different kinds of attention. It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time.**
- **Information cannot be saved in short-term memory, it seeks our attention and occupies valuable mental resources until it is either forgotten, replaced by something more important (according to our brains) or moved into long-term memory.**
- **We don’t actually have to finish tasks to convince our brains to stop thinking about them. All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of.**

## Creativity
-  **The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.**
- **Creativity is just connecting things.**
- **Creative people are connecting things and recognize relationships and connections**
- **Playing and tinkering with ideas is what leads to insight and exceptional texts**
- **To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of abstraction and re-specification.**

## Expertise
- **To be able to become an expert, we need the freedom to make our own decisions and all the necessary mistakes that help us learn**
- **Experts have internalised the necessary knowledge so they don’t have to actively remember rules or think consciously about their choices. They trust their intuition.**
