When you combine purpose, energy, and small simple steps, you get sustainable motivation.

If you’re struggling to find motivation to learn, or to accomplish anything else in your life, there is a good chance you haven’t uncovered the why of the task. 

Use this heuristic/acronym to set smart goals:

- **S** is for Specific: Your goal should be well defined. Don’t say you want to be rich; say you want to make a certain amount of money. 

- **M** is for Measurable: If you can’t measure your goal, you can’t manage it. Getting fit isn’t measurable—running a six-minute mile is. 

- **A** is for Actionable: You wouldn’t drive to a new town without asking for directions. Develop the action steps to achieve your goal.

- **R** is for Realistic: If you’re living in your parents’ basement, it’s hard to become a millionaire. Your goals should challenge and stretch you, but not so much that you give up on them.

- **T** is for Time-based: The phrase, “A goal is a dream with a deadline” comes to mind. Setting a time to complete your goal.
