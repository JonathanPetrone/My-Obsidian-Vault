Scott H. Young in his book  "Ultralearning" talks about the process of metalearning (the first of nine principles for "ultralearners"), which can be described as learning about learning. He mentions that we should make ourselves a learning map, so that we have help to navigate our self-directed learning in order for it to be successful.

He proposes some categories: WHY, WHAT & HOW. (see also the use of these words in [[The golden circle]]) We should go through these categories when we research and/or analyze in order to learn something.

## WHY
In his model he proposes that we start with WHY. 

WHY brings up why we want to learn. In general it could be:
- Instrumentally motivated - In order to be able to do something
- Intrinsically motivated - In order to understand something for the sake of it

## WHAT
After we are clear with our underlying intentions, we can start to map out what we should learn:
- Concepts - Things needed to be understood
- Facts - Things needed to be memorized
- Procedures - Anything needed to be practiced

## HOW
When we want to understand how we should go about learning something, we generally start with Benchmarking, meaning we want to reference a standard or common way in which we could "benchmark" progress. When we have found some reference we can employ the method of emphasizing/excluding different facts or things we need to understand, influenced by our WHY.
