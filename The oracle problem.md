Cem Kaner defines a software testing oracle as a tool that tells you whether the program passed your test. Oracles tend to be [[heuristic]] (A decision rule that is useful but not always correct), therefore if we rely on oracles we might fall into the trap of:

-   Believing the program has passed even though it did something wrong.
-   Believing the program has failed even though it has behaved appropriately.

Software testing oracles are incomplete in their nature as we can’t fully specify the postcondition state of the system under test, therefore no oracle we can use is “complete” in itself.
