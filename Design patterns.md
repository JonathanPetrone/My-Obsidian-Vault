A design pattern is a reusable way of designing something. They revolve around the principle of best practices. A pattern generally has four elements:

- **Name**
	- It has a name.
- **Problem**
	- It has a problem it was created to solve.
- **Solution**
	- It has elements that make up its design.
- **Consequence**
	- It comes with some kind of trade-offs.
