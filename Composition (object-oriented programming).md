Composition is about the fact that objects are often built, or composed, from other objects. Just as with inheritance, composition provides a mechanism for building objects. Composition then represent a part or parts of a greater whole. 

With composition we can build systems by combining less complex parts, and systems and subsystems can be built independently. If we also make parts interchangable, we in turn make them reusable.

Whenever a particular object is composed of other objects, and those objects are included as object fields, the new object is known as a _compound_, an _aggregate_, or a _composite object_.

A composition relationship is termed a _has-a relationship_. 

## The general two types of compistion

Whereas **aggregations** represent relationships where you normally see only the whole, **associations** present both the whole and the parts.

**Aggregation**
It is a one-way relationship.

**Association**
Association is a relation between two separate classes which establishes through their Objects. Association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many.
