Composition is about the fact that objects are often built, or composed, from other objects. Just as with inheritance, composition provides a mechanism for building objects.

A composition relationship is termed a _has-a relationship_.

Whenever a particular object is composed of other objects, and those objects are included as object fields, the new object is known as a _compound_, an _aggregate_, or a _composite object_
