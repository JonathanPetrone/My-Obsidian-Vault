**Slow Feedback:**
- **Irreversible/expensive iterations**: Mistakes consume significant resources (time/money/materials/opportunity)
- **Long validation cycles**: Months to decades before outcomes clear
- **Attempt scarcity**: Dozens or fewer full attempts in a lifetime
- **Delayed error detection**: Mistakes may not surface until far downstream
- **Compressed practice**: Career might span only 10-30 complete iterations
- **Ambiguous causation**: Hard to isolate what caused success/failure due to temporal distance
- **Survivor bias risk**: Only see results from those who lasted long enough

**Complicated:**
- **Deterministic/probabilistic but stable**: Same inputs → same outputs (or predictable distributions)
- **Decomposable**: Can break into analyzable sub-components
- **Teachable through rules**: Expertise can be systematically transmitted via procedures
- **Pattern libraries exist**: Catalogues of solutions to known problem types
- **Expertise compounds predictably**: More experience → monotonically better performance
- **Best practices converge**: Experts agree on "right" approaches
- **Mistakes have systematic causes**: Failures are analyzable, preventable through better technique
- **Bounded problem space**: Known unknowns, not unknown unknowns

You're building expertise in pattern recognition where the patterns are real and stable, but you get very few chances to test your mental models against reality.

## Examples:
- Gemstone cutting
- Chemical plant safety protocols
- Plant breeding programs
