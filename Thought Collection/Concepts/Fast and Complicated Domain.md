**Fast Feedback**
- **Iteration frequency**: Minutes to days between attempts
- **Reversibility**: Low-cost failures, easy reset to try again
- **Attempt volume**: Hundreds/thousands of reps possible per year
- **Error visibility**: Mistakes immediately obvious (wrong move, missed note, failed test)
- **Practice density**: Can achieve 10,000 hours in 5 years of deliberate practice
- **Learning curve shape**: Rapid initial improvement visible within weeks
- **Skill verification**: Can confirm mastery through repeated demonstration in short timeframe

**Complicated:**
- **Deterministic/probabilistic but stable**: Same inputs → same outputs (or predictable distributions)
- **Decomposable**: Can break into analyzable sub-components
- **Teachable through rules**: Expertise can be systematically transmitted via procedures
- **Pattern libraries exist**: Catalogues of solutions to known problem types
- **Expertise compounds predictably**: More experience → monotonically better performance
- **Best practices converge**: Experts agree on "right" approaches
- **Mistakes have systematic causes**: Failures are analyzable, preventable through better technique
- **Bounded problem space**: Known unknowns, not unknown unknowns
