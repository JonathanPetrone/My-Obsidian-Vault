**Fast Feedback**
- **Iteration frequency**: Minutes to days between attempts
- **Reversibility**: Low-cost failures, easy reset to try again
- **Attempt volume**: Hundreds/thousands of reps possible per year
- **Error visibility**: Mistakes immediately obvious (wrong move, missed note, failed test)
- **Practice density**: Can achieve 10,000 hours in 5 years of deliberate practice
- **Learning curve shape**: Rapid initial improvement visible within weeks
- **Skill verification**: Can confirm mastery through repeated demonstration in short timeframe

**Complex:**
- **Emergent properties**: System behavior not predictable from components alone
- **Non-stationary**: Patterns evolve, rules rewrite themselves over time
- **Reflexive**: Observer/participant actions change the system
- **Context-dependent**: What works in situation A fails in situation B for non-obvious reasons
- **Irreducible uncertainty**: Genuine novelty emerges, not just unknown-but-knowable facts
- **Multiple stable states**: Same initial conditions can lead to divergent outcomes
- **Network effects**: Relationships between elements matter more than elements themselves
- **Adaptive adversaries**: System responds to your strategies (markets, social systems)
