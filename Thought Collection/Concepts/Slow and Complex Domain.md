**Slow Feedback:**
- **Irreversible/expensive iterations**: Mistakes consume significant resources (time/money/materials/opportunity)
- **Long validation cycles**: Months to decades before outcomes clear
- **Attempt scarcity**: Dozens or fewer full attempts in a lifetime
- **Delayed error detection**: Mistakes may not surface until far downstream
- **Compressed practice**: Career might span only 10-30 complete iterations
- **Ambiguous causation**: Hard to isolate what caused success/failure due to temporal distance
- **Survivor bias risk**: Only see results from those who lasted long enough

**Complex:**
- **Emergent properties**: System behavior not predictable from components alone
- **Non-stationary**: Patterns evolve, rules rewrite themselves over time
- **Reflexive**: Observer/participant actions change the system
- **Context-dependent**: What works in situation A fails in situation B for non-obvious reasons
- **Irreducible uncertainty**: Genuine novelty emerges, not just unknown-but-knowable facts
- **Multiple stable states**: Same initial conditions can lead to divergent outcomes
- **Network effects**: Relationships between elements matter more than elements themselves
- **Adaptive adversaries**: System responds to your strategies (markets, social systems)

- Long-term investing
- Diplomatic relationship building
