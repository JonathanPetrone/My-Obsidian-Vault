The **tacit dimension** refers to the unspoken, implicit part of knowledge that we understand and use without being able to fully articulate it. Philosopher Michael Polanyi introduced this concept, suggesting that a great deal of what we "know" cannot be easily put into words. Tacit knowledge includes skills, intuitions, insights, and even bodily sensations that guide our understanding and actions, like knowing how to ride a bike, recognize a face, or interpret someone’s mood.

### The necessity of Tacit knowledge
Tacit knowledge—our intuitive, experience-based understanding—is according Polanyi essential to all knowledge. This means that striving to remove all personal elements from knowledge would undermine it. Instead, we should according to Polanyi aim to develop more reliable ways of understanding that embrace these personal elements, which is what a theory of tacit knowledge seeks to accomplish.

For example, you can learn to use a machine well without fully understanding how it works. However, an engineer who knows how the machine is built and how it operates has a deeper understanding of it. Similarly, we all have some basic knowledge of how our own bodies work, but a physiologist who studies the body in detail has a more complete and theoretical understanding of it.
