Our awareness of the body's interaction with the world is key to how we perceive and connect to things beyond ourselves. When we use tools or objects to understand something, they become extensions of our body, helping us "dwell" in that understanding.

We can think of the body and tools as an **interface** in obtaining knowledge because they mediate and shape our connection with the world.

By this view, the body and tools don't just passively receive information; they actively participate in knowledge formation. They help us develop tacit knowledge, allowing us to intuitively connect to our surroundings and make sense of complex ideas or skills.
