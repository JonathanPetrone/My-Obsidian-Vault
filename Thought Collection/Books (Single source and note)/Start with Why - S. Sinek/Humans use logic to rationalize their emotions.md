Humans are emotional creatures, we use logic to rationalize our emotions. This is why invoking emotions and inspiring others has such a powerful effect, likewise, manipulation can also have this effect on people by playing on their emotions.

As an example if a customer feels inspired to buy a product, they will verbalize the reasons why they are buying the product/service. In product development, the cause or philosophy which the company adheres to can help inspire customers and create loyal advocates. When the company becomes a symbol for deep-held beliefs in its customers it creates strong emotions in people.
