## Core Concept/Principle:

>"To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, remove things every day" - Lao Tzu. 

Distillation captures the most important aspects and essence of information. Each highlighting decision develops judgment by distinguishing truly important bits from those that don't matter. Value is not evenly distributed in content, making it crucial to capture just the bare minimum.

## Context/Example:
The more economical you can be with material captured in your knowledge system, the less time and effort your future self will need to process it again. 

- **Progressive Summarization technique**: highlight main points of a note, then highlight the main points of those highlights, creating layers of distillation that reveal core insights through iterative refinement.
