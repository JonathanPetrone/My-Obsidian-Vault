## Core Concept/Principle:
To gather information effectively, let go of expectations - there's no right or wrong way. Start in "divergence mode" by opening horizons and exploring every possible option, letting curiosity guide exploration. (Divergence mode resembles the "scout obsessively" principle from buccaneer-scholar methodology. [[Buccaneer-Scholar Self-Education Method]])

When capturing notes, ask "how can I make this most useful for my future self?" This leads to annotation explaining why you saved it, what you were thinking, and what caught your attention. Separate capturing from organizing to avoid limiting resonance-based collection.

## Context/Example:
Information gathering involves clicking every link, jumping between sources, following curiosity without predetermined structure. Create breadcrumbs (references) for follow-up and store in knowledge systems.

The process fits the CODE model: 
- **Capture** (keep what resonates)
- **Organize** (save for actionability)
- **Distill** (find essence)
- **Express** (show your work).
