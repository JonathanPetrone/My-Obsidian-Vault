## Core Concept/Principle:
An external, centralized, digital repository for storing and systematically working with ideas, insights, and connections from experience. A personalized methodology that standardizes information processing while maintaining plasticity to evolve with changing needs and goals over time.

## Context/Example:
Store information from diverse sources (text, video, conversations) with references as foundational notes. Like biological brains, the system exhibits plasticity - individual notes and note groups change purpose as needs evolve. Regular habits of reviewing and reorganizing shape the system to fit current information requirements. 

**Four essential capabilities**: 
- Making ideas concrete
- Revealing new associations between ideas
- Incubating ideas over time
- Sharpening unique perspectives
