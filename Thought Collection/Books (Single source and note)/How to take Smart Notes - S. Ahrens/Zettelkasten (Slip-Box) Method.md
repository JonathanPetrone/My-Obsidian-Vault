## Core Concept/Principle:
A bottom-up note organization system using numbered indexing rather than hierarchical categories, prioritizing future connections between information. The system acts as external long-term memory, freeing mental resources while enabling idea combination and pattern recognition through three distinct note types.

## Context/Example:
Niklas Luhmann, German sociologist, used slip-boxes (Zettelkästen) with numerical indexing where related notes received similar indexes. 

He took three types of notes: 
- **Fleeting notes** (spontaneous ideas for temporary capture)
- **Literature notes** (content summaries from reading)
- **Permanent notes** (original ideas and information combinations stored separately). This enabled building note clusters, combining them, and preparing ordered sequences.

**Implementation Rules**: Write one note per idea, write for others using full sentences with disclosed sources and references, be precise and brief. Digital notes should fit on screen without scrolling. Notes derive value from context (not necessarily original context) - capture what resonates regardless of source.
