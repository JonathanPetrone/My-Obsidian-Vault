## Rules of thumb in note-taking
When you take notes in a Zettelkasten-based system you generally want to:
- Write one note for each idea
- Write as if you were writing for someone else: 
	- Use full sentences
	- Disclose your sources
	- Make references 
	- Try to be as precise and brief as possible
- If you work in a digital space any one note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling, then maybe you need to trim or divide the note.

The type of note you capture can vary (see: [[Zettelkasten (slip-box) method]]), is it a:
- Fleeting note?
- Litterature note?
- Permanent note?

Something to keep in mind is that one note is only as valuable as its context, which is not necessarily the context it is taken from, feel free to take notes of things that resonates.
