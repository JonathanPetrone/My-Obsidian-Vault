As long as some information is in our short-term memory it constantly seek our attention. This means that it occupies valuable mental resources until it is either forgotten, replaced by something more important (according to our brains) or moved into long-term memory.

It is impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time, like editing on one text and making connections between other notes at the same time. Multitasking is really just switching between different things, and this lowers the quality of work and it also impairs our ability to deal with more than one thing at a time.

To solve this we can write down things occupying our short-term memory, this convinces our brains that the information or thought is taken care of and we can free up  resources in our brain.
