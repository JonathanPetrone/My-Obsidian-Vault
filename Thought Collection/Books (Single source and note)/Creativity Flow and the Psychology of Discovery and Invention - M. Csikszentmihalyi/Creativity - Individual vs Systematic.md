## Core Concept/Principle:
**Definition from Oxford:**
"The use of skill and imagination to produce something new or to produce art" (Oxford), often involving guiding intention. 

**Creativity according to Csikszentmihalyi:**
Csikszentmihalyi argues the common term covers too much ground and defines it as "a process by which a symbolic domain in the culture is changed." True creativity involves intentionality, emotional resonance, and intrinsic purpose - qualities that distinguish human creativity from machine simulation of creative outputs.

## Context/Example:
**The definition raises questions about subjectivity:** 
"Who is right: the individual who believes in their own creativity, or the social milieu that denies it?" 

If we side with the individual, creativity becomes **subjective** - requiring only inner assurance that what you think or do is new and valuable. Csikszentmihalyi's systems model shows **creativity emerging from domain-field-person** interactions rather than individual inspiration alone. (see: [[The Systems Model of Creativity]] )
