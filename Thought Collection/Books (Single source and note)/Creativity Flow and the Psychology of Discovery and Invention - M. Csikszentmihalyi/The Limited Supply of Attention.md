## What do we mean by a Limited Supply of Attention?

This is a concept exploring how attention is a finite resource that must be carefully managed. As demonstrated by Einstein's uniform wardrobe choice (He was cutting down on the daily effort involved in deciding what clothes to wear by having the same clothes often), even small decisions consume attention, and when aggregated, can significantly impact our cognitive resources available for more important tasks.

Therefore we could create strategies, like Einstein, to lower our overall cognitive burden by using our limited supply of attention on things that matter, rather than trivial stuff.

## Key Aspects:
- **Finite Resource:** Attention cannot be infinitely divided
- **Cumulative Impact:** Small attention costs add up over time
- **Selection Necessity:** Must choose what to focus on due to limitations
- **Domain Filtering:** Fields help filter what's worth attention

## Similar:
- Flow states (effortless attention)
- Automated processes (requiring minimal attention)
- Mindless activities (no conscious attention needed)
## Opposite:
- Decision fatigue (depletion of energy from making choices)
- Cognitive load theory (mental effort in working memory)
- Information overload (too much input to process)
