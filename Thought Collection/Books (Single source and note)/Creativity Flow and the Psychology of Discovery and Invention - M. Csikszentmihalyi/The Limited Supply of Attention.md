## Core Concept/Principle:
Attention is a finite resource that must be carefully managed. Even small decisions consume attention, and when aggregated, significantly impact cognitive resources available for important tasks. Strategic attention allocation, like Einstein's uniform wardrobe choice to reduce daily decision-making, can preserve cognitive capacity for meaningful work by minimizing trivial attention costs.

## Context/Example:
Einstein wore the same clothes daily to eliminate the cognitive effort of choosing what to wear, preserving attention for physics research. This demonstrates how seemingly minor decisions accumulate into substantial cognitive burden. 

Key Aspects: 
- **Finite Resource** (attention cannot be infinitely divided)
- **Cumulative Impact** (small attention costs compound)
- **Selection Necessity** (must choose focus due to limitations)
- **Domain Filtering** (fields help filter what deserves attention).
