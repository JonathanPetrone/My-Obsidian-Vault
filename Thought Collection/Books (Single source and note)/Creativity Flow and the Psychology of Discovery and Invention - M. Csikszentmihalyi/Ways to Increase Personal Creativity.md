The first step toward a more creative life is the cultivation of curiosity and interest, that is, the allocation of attention to things for their own sake.

### Tips:

- Try to be surprised by something every day.
- Try to surprise at least one person every day. 
- Write down each day what surprised you and how you surprised others.
- When something strikes a spark of interest, follow it.
- Wake up in the morning with a specific goal to look forward to.
- If you do anything well, it becomes enjoyable. 
- To keep enjoying something, you need to increase its complexity.
- Take charge of your schedule.
- Make time for reflection and relaxation.
- Shape your space.
- Find out what you like and what you hate about life.
- Start doing more of what you love, less of what you hate.
- To change personality means to learn new patterns of attention.
- Develop what you lack.
- Keep exploring what it takes to be the opposite of who you are.
- Shift often from openness to closure. 
- Aim for complexity.
- Find a way to express what moves you. 
- Look at problems from as many viewpoints as possible.
- Figure out the implications of the problem. 
- Implement the solution.
- Produce as many ideas as possible.
- Have as many different ideas as possible. 
- Try to produce unlikely ideas.

It is important to try as many domains as possible. Start with things you already enjoy and then move to related domains.

Creative people are constantly surprised. They don’t assume that they understand what is happening around them, and they don’t assume that anybody else does either.
