Creativity can be observed only in the interrelations of a system made up of three parts.

- **The domain** (consists of a set of symbolic rules and procedures)
- **The field** (which includes all the individuals who act as gatekeepers to the domain)
- **The person** (Creativity occurs when a person, using symbols of a given domain such as music, engineering, mathematics has a new idea or sees a new pattern, and when this novelty is selected by the appropriate field for inclusion in the relevant domain.)

In this view it is not enough to study the individuals who seem most responsible for a novel idea or a new thing. Their contribution, while necessary and important, is only a link in a chain, a phase in a process.

Creativity in this view does not solely happen inside people’s heads, but in the interaction between a person’s thoughts and a sociocultural context.

Perhaps the most important implication of the systems model is that the level of creativity in a given place at a given time does not depend only on the amount of individual creativity. It depends just as much on how well suited the respective domains and fields are to the recognition and diffusion of novel ideas.
