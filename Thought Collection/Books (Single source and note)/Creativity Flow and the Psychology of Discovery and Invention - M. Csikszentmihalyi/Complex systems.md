## Core Concept/Principle:
Complex systems are those whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to dependencies, competitions, relationships, and interactions between parts or with their environment. The study of complex systems investigates how relationships between parts give rise to collective behaviors and environmental interactions. Complexity combines differentiation (many distinctive parts) with integration (parts working together smoothly).

## Context/Example:
Complex systems exhibit distinct properties arising from relationships: 
- **nonlinearity** (small changes can have large effects)
- **emergence** (system properties not present in individual parts)
- **spontaneous order** (organization without central control)
- **adaptation** (learning and evolution)
- **feedback loops** (outputs influencing inputs) 
 
Complexity exists across all scales from simple amoeba to sophisticated human cultures, characterized by both high differentiation and smooth integration.
