## Core Concept/Principle:
Creativity can only be observed in the interrelations of a three-part system: 
- **The Domain** (symbolic rules and procedures)
- **The Field** (gatekeepers who select novelties)
- **The Person** (who generates new ideas using domain symbols). 

Creativity occurs when a person sees new patterns that are selected by the field for inclusion in the domain. Individual contribution is necessary but only one phase in a larger process.

## Context/Example:
Creativity doesn't happen solely inside people's heads, but in the interaction between thoughts and sociocultural context. A musician creates using musical symbols (domain), but the idea only becomes "creative" when music critics, producers, or audiences (field) recognize and adopt it into musical culture (domain). The level of creativity in a place/time depends equally on individual innovation and how well domains and fields recognize and diffuse novel ideas.
