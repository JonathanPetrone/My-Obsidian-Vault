A decision is a judgment, often it is more of a choice between two courses of actions.

The effective decision-maker organizes disagreement. This protect him against being taken in by the plausible but false or incomplete. He uses conflict of opinion as his tool to make sure all major aspects of an important matter are looked at carefully.

Every decision is like a surgery. It is an intervention into a system and therefore carries with it the risk of shock. If we do not act, we will in all probability survive. But if we do act, we may be better off.

There is no inherent reason why medicines should taste horrible -- but effective ones usually do. Similarly, there is no inherent reason why decisions should be distasteful -- but effective ones are.
