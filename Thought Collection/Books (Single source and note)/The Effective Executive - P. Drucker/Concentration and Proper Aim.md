If there is a secret to effectiveness, it is concentration. Effective executives do first things first and one thing at a time.

The secret to people who do "so many things" is that they do one thing at a time.

Ask:
- If we did not already do this, would we go into it now?

Always ask is still still worth doing? This is important for organizational "weight control".

Analysis of priorities:
- Pick the future against the past
- Focus on opportunity, rather than on problems
- Change your own direction, rather than climbing the bandwagon
- Aim high, aim for something that will make a difference, rather than for something that is safe and easy to do.

The effective executive does not, truly commit himself beyond the one task he concentrates on right now.

Concentration is the only hope of becoming the master of time and events.
