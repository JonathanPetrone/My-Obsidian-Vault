If learning is making new connections, then remembering is maintaining and sustaining those connections. When we struggle with memory or experience memory impairment, we are likely experiencing a disconnection between neurons. 

In learning, when you fail to remember something, view it as a "failure to make a connection between what you’ve learned and what you already know, and with how you will use it in life."

If we respond to this lapse in memory with the attitude that “I have a bad memory,” or “I’m not smart enough to remember this,” then we negatively affect our ability to learn and grow.
