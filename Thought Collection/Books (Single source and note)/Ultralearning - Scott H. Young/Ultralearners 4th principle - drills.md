A drill is a repeated exercise of an isolated part/component of what is being learned. We can deconstruct what makes up direct practice into smaller chunks and attack those isolated parts instead of practicing everything at once all the time. This is useful if we lack skill in certain parts of what we are learning and if practicing these separated parts of the whole will provide a greater boost to our overall performance in the future.

Scott H. Young has a method for working with drills which he calls the "Direct-then-Drill approach":
1. **First practice the skill directly** - This means figuring out the where and how, and then match the context.
2. **Isolate components** - We want to identify and isolate components that are rate-determining steps in our performance or subskills we might find difficult to improce because there are too many other things going on for you to focus on them.
3. **Integration** - We then want to go back to the direct practice (the whole experience) and integrate what we practiced and learned.

As a rule-of-thumb the earlier we are in the learning process the faster the cycle of the "Direct-then-Drill approach" should be. Later on longer detours into drills is more acceptable. The closer you are to mastery, in general,  the more viable focusing on drills will be.

## General problems with applying drills
**1. Figuring out what and when to drill**
	- Focus on what would cause the biggest improvement to your abilities overall
	- Experiment, make a hypothesis, and test it with a "Direct-then-Drill approach" session. This gives you feedback
**2. Designing the actual drill to produce improvement**
**3. Drills are hard work & uncomfortable**

**Useful tips when designing drills or doing drills:**
1. **Time-slicing** (doing a sequence of actions in a set slice of time)
2. **Identify cognitive components** (eg. in learning a language there is grammar, pronounciation and vocabulary)
3. **Copy parts** of the skill you don't want to practice in the drill
4. **Spend more time on a certain part of the activity** than the rest of the parts 
5. **Pre-requisite chaining** - Start with a skill you don't have all the pre-requisites for, then go back a step, learn some foundational knowledge and then repeat.
