By trying out new variations when you learn you quickly get feedback on what works or what role some parts of the whole has. Scott H. Young talks a lot about Van Gogh in the chapter of experimentation as Van Gogh was notorious for trying out new styles, resources or methods when he painted. Van Gogh would focus heavily and create lots of works and then switch setup in some way and repeat the process. This also let him find a style that worked for him.

Van Gogh's could be said to have followed the path of a scientist: hypothesis, experiment, results, repeat.

One interesting situation that often is true is that complete novices tend to have quite similar knowledge the closer you get to expert level there is a bigger chance of differentiation in some ways. This makes improving expert level skills you have acquired an personalized and idiosyncratic adventure.

Our abilities tend to stagnate after you have mastered the basics. Getting better, however increasingly becomes an act of unlearning; not only must you learn to solve problems you couldn't before, you must unlearn stale and ineffective approaches for solving those problem.

## Three types of experimentation
1. **Experimenting with learning resources**
2. **Experimenting with techniques**
	- As you improve, however, the amount of things you could possibly learn next becomes larger and larger.
3. **Experimenting with style**
	- After you've matured in your learning a bit, the difficulty often switches from which resources to learn from techniques you'd like to master to the style you'd like to cultivate. For this you also need to gain knowledge of all styles that exists. One thing you can do is study different masters and dissect their styles to see what you can emulate and integrate.

In each level of experimentation, the choices broaden and the possible options to explore go up exponentionally. Theerefore you have to decide how muc refinement you want to spend on trying out stuff vs. mastering one approach.

## Tactics to help you integrate experimentation
1. **Copy then create**
	- Copying simplifies the problem of experimentation somewhat becauseit gives you a starting point for making decisions.
	- Also in attempting to emulate something you have to deconstruct it to understand why/how it works.
2. **Compare methods side-by-side**
	- You can vary a single variable or condition to see what the impact is.
3. **Introduce new constraints**
	- You can introduce new constraints that make the old methods impossible to use.
4. **Find your superpower in the hybrid of unrelated skills**
	- Combine two skills that don't necessarily overlap to bring about a distinct advantage that those who specialize in only one of those skills do not have.
5. **Explore the extremes**
	- You can imagine learning a complex subject as akin to trying to find an optimal point in a region of higher-dimensional space except that insted of length, width and height, those dimensions might be the qualitative dimensions of work, sych as Van Gogh's complementarity of colors, application of paint etc. Like changing a variable to the extreme.
