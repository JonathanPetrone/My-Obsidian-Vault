Intuition is the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning, can also be described as an instinctive feeling. You don't always develop a deep intuition just because you have spent a lot of time studying.

Scott H. Young talks a lot about Richard Feynman's approach to learning and how Feynman built his intuition.

## Feyman's learning rules:
1. **Don't give up on problems easily**
	- Force yourself to dedicate 10 more minutes on a hard problem
2. **Prove things to understand them**
	- The illusion of understanding is very often the barrier to deeper knowledge, because unless that competency is actually tested, it's easy to mislead yourself into thinking you understand more than you do.
3. **Always start with a concrete example**
	- Human beings don't learn things very well in the abstract. Most people learn abstract, general rules only after being exposed to many concrete examples.
4. **Don't fool yourself**
	- "Don't fool yourself,  and you're the easiest person to fool" Be skeptical of your own understanding. Ask a lot of questions. Ask "dumb" questions. This mitigates the risk of you fooling yourself.

## The Feynman technique
When you don't understand an idea at all or simply when you understand something a little but really want to turn if into a deep intuition.

1. Write down the concept or problem you want to understand at the top of a piece of paper.
2. In the space below, explain the idea as if you had to teach it to someone else.
	- If it's a concept, ask yourself how you would convey the idea to someone who has never heard of it before.
	- If it's a problem, explain how to solve it and --crucially-- why that solution procedure makes sense to you.
3. When you get stuck, go back to your book, notes, teacher or reference material to find the answer.

Since much of our own understanding is never articulated, it's easy for us to think we understand something that we don't. This technique helps solve this problem. 

You can apply the Feynman technique to:

1. Things you don't understand
2. For problems you can't seem to solve
3. For expanding your intuition
