In order to understand learning we must understand how and why we forget. We tend to forget things quickly after learning them, there being an exponential decay in knowledge , which is steepest just right after learning.

Our minds could be described as leaky buckets.

There are three dominant theories of why we forget:
1. **Decay** - Memories decay over time
2. **Interference** - Our memories overlap, memories that are similar but distinct compete with each other.
	- Proactive interference: Previosuly learned information makes learning harder.
	- Retroacive interference: New learning suppresses old memory
3. **Forgotten cues** - Memories aren't forgotten but simply "inaccessible".
	- Could explain why relearning things is easier, as it resembles repair work.

Because one aspect of learning is battling our tendency to forget we have to devise strategies for preventing forgetting what we learn.

## Methods for improving retention
1. **Spacing** - Repeat to remember (don't cram everything into just one time slot)
2. **Proceduralization** - Proceduralized skills (like riding a bike) are much less susceptible to being forgotten than knowledge that requires explicit recalls to retrieve. 
	- One way to proceduralize is to emphasize a core set of information much more frequently.
3. **Overlearning** - If you practice beyond what is needed to perform adequately you can increase the length of time memories are stored.
4. **Mnemonics** - Mnemonics are devices such as a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations that assists in remembering something
