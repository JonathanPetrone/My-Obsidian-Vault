Simon Sinek says that there are two kinds of games, Finite and Infinite ones. 

Infinite games in contrast to finite games have infinite time horizons. There is also no such thing as "winning" an infinite game. In an infinite game you want to be able to keep playing the game for as long as you can.

There is for example no such thing as winning education, global politics, or relationships.

Recognizing if we are playing Finite or Infinite Games can be useful for making better decisions.
