Simon Sinek says that there are two kinds of games, Finite and Infinite ones. 

Finite games are played with known players. They have fixed rules. There is also an agreed-upon objective, when reached, ends the game.

Football is an example of such a game. If you break a rule you get penalty and the team with the most points at the end of a game wins.

Recognizing if we are playing Finite or Infinite Games can be useful for making better decisions.
