### Learning from Failure
W. Churchill once said "The trick is to go from one failure to another, with no loss of enthusiasm"

How to learn from failure? By questioning:
- Why did it fail?
- What can I take with me?
### Questioning Failing
What would you attempt if you knew you couldn't fail? 

But you could also consider:
- What if I fail -- how will I recover?

The thought of it is often more scary than the failing itself.

What's truly worth doing, whether you fail or succeed?
