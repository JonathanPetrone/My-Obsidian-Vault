### Sitting with Questions
Often the worst thing you can do with a difficult question is to try to answer it too quickly. When the mind is coming up with "What If" possibilities these new ideas can take time to form.

What sets apart the innovative questioners is their ability, mostly born out of persistence and determination to give form to their ideas and make them real. When done asking the "Why" and "What Ifs", they shift into "How can I".

Effective questioners let each answer they stumble upon bring with it a new wave of questions.
