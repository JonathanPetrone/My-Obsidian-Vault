### A Culture of Inquiry
"How can we create a culture of inquiry?" is an important question, but the question is also "do we want a culture of inquiry?". 

Employees with leeway to question, would mean policies can be challenged. Maybe leaders or managers don't want to have to explain and rationalize or feel their authority threatened. Also, those with expertise may resent having their learned views questioned by non-experts.

If you do still want a culture of inquiry leaders have to walk the talk, you also have to look for ways get punished or rewarded. Like punishing someone to fix the problem they identified themselves.

One of the best ways to grow a culture of inquiry is to hire people who are naturally inquisitive. look for the questions applicants ask.

### Schools are Like Factories
To the extent that a school is like a factory, students who inquire about "the way things are", could be seen as insubordinate. If schools were built on a factory model, were they actually designed to squelch questions.

What if our schools could train students to be lifelong learners and better adapt to change, by enabling them to become better questioners.

How might we create such a school?
