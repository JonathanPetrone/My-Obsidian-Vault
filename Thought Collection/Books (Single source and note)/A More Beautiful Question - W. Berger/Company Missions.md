### Company Mission
Most businesses would acknowledge that it is in business to make money so that it can stay in business. However, most good companies are born trying to answer a question and solve a problem. 

Sometimes companies have to ask again what they do and who they serve. 

For any organization it is galvanizing to have a strong purpose and values, no matter what they might be.

The company mission can be articulated as a question, this tells the world we are not "there" yet, but on a journey.

### What Companies Shouldn't Do
J. Bergstrand thinks one of the most important question companies should ask regularly is what we should stop doing? We tend to focus on what we should start doing.

### A Better Experiment
A good question is how can we make a better experiment. 

It's somewhat counter-intuitive for most managers - who tend to think in terms of "making products", not "making experiments".

Sometimes it's good to instead of asking: "What will we do or build?", to ask "What will we learn?"

### Leaders in Business Should Ask Questions
Business leaders should be the chief question asker for their organization. When leading a team, a start-up or a public company, your primary occupation must be to discover the future. Questions are a good way for navigating uncharted terrain.
