### Questioning the Question
Sometimes it's useful to question our questions.

- Why did I come up with that question?
- What are the underlying assumptions?
- Is there a different question I should be asking?

You can use the Five WHY's technique with this or use opening and closing of questions.

Why is my father-in-law so hard to get along with? (open) vs. Is my father-in-law hard to get along with? (closed)

### Asking Questions Closer to the Context
Contextual inquiry is about asking questions up close and in the context. There we can observe, listen, and use empathy to guide us toward more intelligent, and therefore more effective questions.

### Tone is Important When Asking Questions
"Oh my god, what are we going to do?" vs. "What if this represents an opportunity for us? How might we make most out of this situation?"

### How Might We?
"How might we"  is a good way to ask, don't do "can" or "should"
