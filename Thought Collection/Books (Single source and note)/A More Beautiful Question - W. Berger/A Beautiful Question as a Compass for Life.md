### What is a Beautiful Question?
The definition of a "beautiful question" from the book is:

"A beautiful question is an ambitious yet actionable question that can begin to shift the way we perceive or think about something which can be the starting point for change."

A personal, yet beautiful question could focus on creating a more fulfilled, more curious, more interesting you.

Like "How do I stay inspired?"

### Questions as a Compass for Life
In a rapidly changing world there isn't a step-by-step map, the best you can hope to have is a good compass to guide you.

**Questions:**
- Why am I climbing this mountain?
- What is waiting for me at the top?
- What am I going to do once I get there?
- Am I enjoying the climb itself? Should I slow down or speed up?
- What am I leaving behind down below?

If you are comfortable questioning, experimenting, connecting things, changes become like an adventure.

There will be no definite answer, at least not for the creative individual who wants to keep growing, improving, innovating. To say I figured it out "this is what I do" and "how I do it", is to play it safe and risk everything.
