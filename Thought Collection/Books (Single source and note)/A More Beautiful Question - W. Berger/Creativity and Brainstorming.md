### Questions as a Brainstorming Tool
Heilman notes, since divergent thinking is about "Hey what if I think differently about this?" it is actually a form of asking questions.

What we know about divergent thinking is that it mostly happens in the more creative right hemisphere of the brain; that it taps into imagination and often trigger random associations of ideas (which is the primary source for creativity)

### What If and Combinatoral Thinking
What if questions often involves the ability to combine ideas and influences. Combinatoral thinking is basically this idea.

Not all combinations are equal, in terms of yielding creative insights.

The more obvious combinations happen in the left hemisphere of the brain, the big insights that can solve problems or come up with highly creative new ideas, often involve these remote connections that can happen in the right hemisphere.

### Bonus:
Rothstein and Santana then designed a program for K–12 classrooms, broken down into a series of steps: 
- **Teachers design a Question Focus** (e.g., “Torture can be justified”). 
- **Students produce questions** (no help from the teacher; no answering or debating the questions; write down every question; change any statements into questions).
- **Students improve their questions** (opening and closing them).
- **Students prioritize their questions**. They are typically instructed to come to agreement on three favorites. 
- **Students and teachers decide on next steps**, for acting on the prioritized questions.
- **Students reflect** on what they have learned.
