The sentiment from the book is that facts are less important when technology more and more has it covered.

### Questions can Lead to Discoveries
S. Firestein argues that one of the keys to scientific discovery is the willingness of the scientists to embrace ignorance and use questions as a means to navigate towards new discoveries.

Questions can lead to many answers, searches for solutions, and can generate new fields of inquiry etc. Answers on the other hand, often ends the process.

### The Quest for Answers
You don't just "find" answers to complex life problems, you work your way there.

We have to construct meaning, not find it.

There is nothing wrong with not having answers to questions, it's the nature of complex tasks at times. We need to be comfortable with uncertainty.

The more you are questioning the easier it gets. We should make it a habit and process, otherwise we won't find time.
