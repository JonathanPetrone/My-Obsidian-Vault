### Evading Inquiry?
Why are you evading inquiry?
- Questioning is seen as counter-productive (we want answers)
- It's not the right time
- Knowing what to ask is difficult
- What if we don't have good answers to our questions
### Where do You Shine?
Think about and question what time, place, and activity in your life where you shine the most and feel most alive. Identify and appreciate it.

- Why do shine when I do X?
- Can I incorporate this in my life more?

### Neoteny
Neoteny means "retention of childlike attributes in adulthood", we should strive to be somewhat neotenous when it comes to learning and exploring. We should use questions just like a child to make sense of the world.
