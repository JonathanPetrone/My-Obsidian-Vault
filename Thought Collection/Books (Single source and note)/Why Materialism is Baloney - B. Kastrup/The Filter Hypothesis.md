**Core claim:** The brain doesn't _produce_ consciousness—it _localizes_ and _constrains_ it. The brain filters universal consciousness down to the specific perspective of your body in space-time.

**Prediction 1 - Unbound consciousness:** If the brain is a filter rather than a generator, then unfiltered consciousness must be unitary and non-individualized. Boundaries and separation are effects of the filtering process, not fundamental features of consciousness itself.

**Prediction 2 - Collective unconscious:** Unlike materialism, this predicts a shared reservoir of potential experiences beyond genetic programming. When filtering mechanisms weaken (naturally or intentionally), these collective contents can break through into individual awareness.

**Prediction 3 - Brain-independent experiences:** The filter model predicts experiences that _don't_ correlate with brain states—because the brain's role is to restrict experience, not generate it. When the filter is bypassed, consciousness persists.

#### **Empirical Support for the Filter Hypothesis**

**Jung's collective unconscious:** Jung observed that dreams, visions, and altered states reveal mental contents that aren't personal—shared images and narratives common across humanity (possibly all consciousness). These are normally filtered out but can break through under specific conditions.

**The psychedelic paradox:** Psychedelics produce extraordinarily complex, intense, transpersonal experiences. The materialist assumption was that they _excite_ brain regions associated with such experiences. Recent research shows the opposite: **psychedelics decrease brain activity.**

**The inverse correlation:** The _more_ intense and complex the experience, the _less_ brain activation measured. This is exactly what the filter hypothesis predicts: reducing brain activity weakens the filter, allowing more consciousness through.

**The broader pattern:** Peak transpersonal experiences—across multiple contexts (meditation, near-death, psychedelics)—consistently correlate with _reduced_ or _eliminated_ brain activity, not increased. Individual reports might be dismissed, but this pattern is robust and replicable.

**Materialism's problem:** If the brain generates consciousness, more intense experience should require _more_ neural activity. The consistent inverse relationship contradicts this and cannot be explained within materialist metaphysics.
