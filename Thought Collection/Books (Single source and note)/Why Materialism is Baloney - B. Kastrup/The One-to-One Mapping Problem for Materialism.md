If sadness _is_ a neural process (materialism's claim), then there must be specific, consistent brain parameters that always correspond to feeling sad. Neuroscience has failed to find this consistent mapping despite decades of research and massive investment.

The materialist response: "We just haven't found it yet—give us more time." But this is unfalsifiable speculation. More importantly, current evidence _contradicts_ the existence of such mappings rather than simply failing to confirm them.
