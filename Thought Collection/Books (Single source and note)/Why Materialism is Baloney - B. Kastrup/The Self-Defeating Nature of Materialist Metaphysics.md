The materialism is a dominant world view in the West, it subtly pervades our expectations, value systems, goals, and nearly every aspect of our lives.

Kastrup argues that successfully modeling nature's patterns doesn't reveal what reality _fundamentally is_. Many scientists conflate these: they treat empirical success as proof that materialism (the metaphysical claim) is true, when it only proves the models work.

**Materialism's core claim:** Consciousness is produced by brain matter—nothing more than particles arranged in specific ways.

**The self-defeat problem:** If materialism is correct, then consciousness arose through blind evolutionary processes optimizing for survival, not truth-tracking. This means our cognitive faculties—including the reasoning that led us to materialism—are unreliable. We're essentially locked in a room, trying to understand the universe through a peephole that distorts everything we see. If materialism is true, we have no reason to trust materialism itself.

Kastrup argues that our ability to model the patterns and regularities of reality tells us little about the underlying nature of things. Many people – including many scientists – easily confuse the two, mistakenly construing the empirical evidence collected from nature through the scientific method to lend direct support to the materialist metaphysics.
