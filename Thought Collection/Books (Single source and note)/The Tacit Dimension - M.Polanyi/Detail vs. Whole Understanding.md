## Core Concept/Principle:
To understand something without talking about it, we need awareness of details, but focusing too much on details causes us to lose sight of the bigger picture. Understanding and the thing itself exist as two levels of reality, each with its own principles. The higher level relies on the lower level but cannot be fully explained by it. We need to see both the details of parts and the systems/overlapping systems that form the whole.

## Context/Example:
A chess game is controlled by principles that depend on following chess rules, but these principles cannot be explained just by the rules themselves. When analyzing a text closely by breaking it into smaller parts, this helps understanding but can also make it difficult to appreciate the text as a whole. The comprehensive entity emerges from but transcends its constituent elements.
