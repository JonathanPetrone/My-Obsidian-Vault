## Core Concept/Principle:
Our awareness of the body's interaction with the world is key to how we perceive and connect to things beyond ourselves. When we use tools or objects to understand something, they become extensions of our body, helping us "dwell" in that understanding. The body and tools function as an active interface in knowledge formation, mediating and shaping our connection with the world.

## Context/Example:
The body and tools don't passively receive information; they actively participate in knowledge formation. Through physical interaction, tools become extensions that help us develop tacit knowledge, allowing intuitive connection to surroundings and making sense of complex ideas or skills. This embodied interface mediates our understanding and shapes how we perceive and interact with reality.
