## Core Concept/Principle:
Knowledge that is hard to express and isn't formally learned, based on people's experiences, actions, and behaviors. The unspoken, implicit part of knowledge that includes skills, intuitions, insights, and bodily sensations (like riding a bike, recognizing faces, interpreting moods). Tacit knowledge is essential to ALL knowledge - striving to remove personal elements would undermine knowledge itself rather than improve it.

## Context/Example:
Mathematical theory creation requires previous understanding and experiences, and mathematical theory application requires relating it to previous experiences. The idea of completely objective, experience-free knowledge is therefore self-contradictory. 

Polanyi's four aspects of tacit knowledge: 
- **Functional** (how it operates/its purpose)
- **Phenomenal** (what is subjectively experienced)
- **Semantic** (meaning/interpretation)
- **Ontological** (fundamental characteristics and relationships to the world).
