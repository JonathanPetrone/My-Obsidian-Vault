## Core Concept/Principle:
An autonomous, curiosity-driven learning approach that emphasizes authentic problem-solving, cognitive awareness, and systematic knowledge building. The method prioritizes personal agency in education through obsessive scouting, experimentation, and critical thinking while leveraging natural learning principles like knowledge attraction and metacognitive awareness.

## Context/Example:
11 Core Elements: 
1) **Scout Obsessively** for resources with curiosity and self-leadership
2) **Solve Authentic Problems** you care about
3) **Learn with Cognitive Savviness** using metacognition and mental rhythms
4) **Knowledge Attracts Knowledge** more knowledge makes learning easier
5) **Experimentation** makes learning vivid through direct engagement
6) **Disposable Time** prevents conservative learning and supports curiosity
7) **Stories** create meaningful arrangements of ideas for memory and understanding
8) **Contrasting Ideas** improve thinking through challenging beliefs and critical analysis
9) **Other Minds** provide ideas to reinvent for yourself
10) **Words and Pictures** as powerful learning tools requiring refinement
11) **Systems Thinking** seeing essential interactions while ignoring irrelevant details.
