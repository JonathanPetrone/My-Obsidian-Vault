## Core Concept/Principle:
Science's power doesn't come from handling complexity, but from its genius to know what to ignore. Successful science transforms intractable complex problems into solvable simple ones through strategic elimination, idealization, and separation of concerns.

## Context/Example:
Newton's planetary motion analysis: 

He started with ~10^30,000 equations for all solar system matter, then he ignored "small" celestial bodies, assumed only gravitational forces, used the sun's dominance to separate planet-sun pairs, which made him end up with ~10 solvable equations.

The reduction factor was astronomical - from computationally impossible to pencil-and-paper solvable.
