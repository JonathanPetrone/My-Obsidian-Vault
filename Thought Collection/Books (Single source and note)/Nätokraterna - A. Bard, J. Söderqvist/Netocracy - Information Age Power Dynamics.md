## Core Concept/Principle:
A social theory describing power structures in the information society where "netocrats" - those who control information networks - constitute the new ruling class. Power derives from network position, information flow control, and the ability to absorb, sort, generate, and share valuable information rather than traditional capital or position.

## Context/Example:
Seven principles define netocratic behavior: 
- **Build "attentionality"** (actively participate in information flow)
- **Focus on networks not individuals** (engage in exclusive information-sharing networks)
- **Master netiquette** (openness, generosity, knowledge sharing without self-assertion)
- **Embrace global mobility** (move where opportunities exist) 
- **Develop "dividual" identity** (multiple changing personalities/roles)
- **Think beyond traditional morality** (create own values through "affirmative nihilism")
- **Understand information as power** (critically examine and distinguish valuable information).
