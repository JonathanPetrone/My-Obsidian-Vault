How you generate your forecast determines accuracy more than what credentials you have or what you believe. Tetlock argues that the overperformance of superforecasters is part due to their "Fox-like" attitude (Many Small Ideas), in contrast to Hedgehog (One Big Idea) thinking.

##### Hedgehogs (One Big Idea)
**Approach:** Apply the same analytical framework to every problem—like wearing one pair of tinted glasses you never take off.

**Characteristics:**
- High confidence (90%, 100% predictions)
- Certain language ("impossible," "certain")
- Simple, clean narratives
- Good for media (clear, quotable)

**Results:** Failed to beat random guessing; in long-range forecasts, lost to a dart-throwing chimp.

##### Foxes (Many Small Ideas)
**Approach:** Deploy multiple analytical frameworks, seek information from many sources, then synthesize into a single conclusion.

**Characteristics:**
- Calibrated confidence (nuanced probabilities)
- Tentative language ("maybe," shades of gray)
- Complex narratives ("however," "on the other hand")
- Bad for media (too many qualifications)

**Results:** Beat hedgehogs on both calibration and resolution. Had real foresight.
