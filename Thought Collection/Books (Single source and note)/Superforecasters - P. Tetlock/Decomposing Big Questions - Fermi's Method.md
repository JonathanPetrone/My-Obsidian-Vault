It can be hard to tackle big questions and make accurate predictions. To shrink uncertainty you can replace one big vague question with many smaller concrete questions, this is Fermi's method.

**Example big question:**
How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?

If you can give answers/estimates to these questions, then you can get a rough estimate of the first question.
1. The number of pianos in Chicago
2. How often pianos are tuned each year
3. How long it takes to tune a piano
4. How many hours a year the average piano tuner works

What Italian American physicist Enrico Fermi understood is that by breaking down the question, we can better separate the knowable and the unknowable.

### Two Types of Decomposition
This above example is of **Decomposition for Calculation (Classic Fermi)**
But another way to look at it is **Decomposition for Diagnosis**

##### Decomposition for Diagnosis
In this variant we break down a vague outcome into observable leading indicators:
- "Will North Korea escalate to military conflict?"
- → Rocket tests? Diplomatic rebuffs? Artillery fire? Naval incidents?
