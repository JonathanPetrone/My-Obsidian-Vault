**Core principle:** Extreme results tend to move toward the average on subsequent trials, even without any real change in underlying skill.

**Fast regression = luck-dominated domain**
Coin flip predictions: Someone gets 80% correct on first 104 flips, then ~50% on the next 104. Near-total regression → pure luck.

**Slow regression = skill-dominated domain**
Superforecasters: 70% remain superforecasters year-to-year. Significant consistency → real skill signal.
