Numbers force commitment to beliefs and enable disciplined updating—but only work if you treat them as provisional tools, not oracles. For superforcasters it is argued that what matters is comfort thinking in probabilities rather than categories. 

 Numbers are only as good as:
- What you measure 
- How you measure it
- How you interpret it

The benefit of using numbers is that they force you to commit to a specific belief rather than hide behind linguistic fog. When you say "65% likely," you can't simultaneously mean the opposite. Real experts do think in degrees of confidence, not binary certainty. "Nothing is one hundred percent" which gets pointed out in the book reflects this understanding of complexity.

Probabilistic thinking in practice makes question like:
- "Will X happen?" turn to "How likely is X?"
- "Why did X happen?" (implies determinism) turn to "How did X happen?" (acknowledges contingency)
