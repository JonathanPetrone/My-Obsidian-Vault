It is a classic mistake when making forecasts to have an inside-view dominance — which means generating a compelling narrative from case-specific details while ignoring how rare/common the outcome actually is in similar situations. A better way is to start with the **Outside View (Base Rate)**.

The Renzetti pet example from the book highlights this: people spin elaborate stories from "Italian name" + "one child" while completely ignoring that 62% of households have pets regardless of those details. 

**Outside View (Base Rate)**  
The frequency of an outcome within the appropriate reference class. 

In this example -> American households with pets: 62%

**Inside View (Case Specifics)**  
The particular details of _this_ instance that might justify moving away from the base rate.

In this example -> "But the Renzettis live in a small apartment"
