In order to break down a bigger question and come up with an close estimate you can use Fermi's method. 

How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?

If you can give answers/estimates to these questions, then you can get a rough estimate of the first question.
1. The number of pianos in Chicago
2. How often pianos are tuned each year
3. How long it takes to tune a piano
4. How many hours a year the average piano tuner works

What Italian American physicist Enrico Fermi understood is that by breaking down the question, we can better separate the knowable and the unknowable.
