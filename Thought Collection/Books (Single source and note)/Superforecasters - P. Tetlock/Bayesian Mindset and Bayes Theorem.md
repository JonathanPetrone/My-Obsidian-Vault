The Bayesian Mindset comes from Thomas Bayes attitude and his theorem (called Bayes theorem) which formalizes how you should change your mind. The essence of this mindset can be captured in what J. M. Keynes is reputed to have said but did not, **“When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”**

Having a Bayesian mindset means accepting that knowledge is always probabilistic and contextual.

##### Bayes theorem
New belief = Prior belief × Diagnostic value of new information

Or in probability terms:
- Start with your **prior odds** (what you believed before)
- Multiply by the **likelihood ratio** (how much the new evidence should shift you)
- Get your **posterior odds** (updated belief)

##### The Practical Application
The theorem fights two biases:
1. **Underreaction** (ignoring new evidence): Formula forces you to incorporate new data
2. **Overreaction** (abandoning priors): Formula anchors you to base rates
   
 To adopt the Bayesian spirit/mindset. Ask yourself:

- What's my starting probability? (Prior)
- How much should this evidence shift me? (Likelihood ratio)
- What's my new probability? (Posterior)
