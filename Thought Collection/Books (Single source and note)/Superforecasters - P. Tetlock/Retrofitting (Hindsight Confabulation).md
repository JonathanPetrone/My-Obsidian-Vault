After an outcome occurs, we construct narratives that make it feel inevitable—then forget we couldn't have predicted it beforehand, this is connected to the [[The Explanation Impulse]]

**The pattern:**
1. Event happens
2. Brain generates coherent story connecting prior events to outcome
3. Story feels obvious ("of course that's what happened")
4. You forget the outcome was actually uncertain

**Example - 9/11 and Afghanistan:**

We bundle "9/11" with the invasion and decade of war as if they were one inevitable event. But at each decision point, plausible alternatives existed:

- Taliban could have handed over bin Laden
- Bin Laden could have fled to Pakistan/Yemen
- US could have accepted Taliban's evidence demands

We only see one path in hindsight, forgetting the others were genuinely possible.

**Why this blocks learning:**
When experts make wrong predictions, they retrofit explanations for why the outcome "actually made sense"—preventing them from recognizing they were wrong and learning from it.

**How to mitigate this:** Write down predictions and reasoning _before_ outcomes occur. This prevents retrofitting and forces confrontation with actual accuracy.
