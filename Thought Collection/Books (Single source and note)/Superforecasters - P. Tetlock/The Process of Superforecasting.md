- Unpack the question into components. 
- Distinguish as sharply as you can between the known and unknown and leave no assumptions unscrutinized. 
- Adopt the [[Anchor to Base Rates|Outside view]] and put the problem into a comparative perspective that downplays its uniqueness and treats it as a special case of a wider class of phenomena.
- Then adopt the inside view that plays up the uniqueness of the problem. Also explore the similarities and differences between your views and those of others—and pay special attention to prediction markets and other methods of extracting wisdom from crowds. 
- Synthesize all these different views into a single vision as acute as that of a dragonfly.
- Finally, express your judgment as precisely as you can, using a finely grained scale of probability.
