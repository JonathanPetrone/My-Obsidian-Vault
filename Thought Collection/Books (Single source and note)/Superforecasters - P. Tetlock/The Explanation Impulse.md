[[System 1 & 2|System 1]] unconsciously replaces hard questions with easier related questions, then answers those instead.

**The danger:** You feel confident because the substitute was answerable, even when it doesn't actually address what you need to know.

**Why it happens:** We compulsively fabricate explanations even when we genuinely don't know the answer. The explanation feels true because it's coherent, not because it's accurate.

**Classic example - Market commentary:**

- Hard question: "Why did the market move?" (unknowable)
- Easy substitute: "What news fits a plausible story?" (always answerable)

The journalist isn't lying—they can't detect the switch.

%%Important%%
**Where this fails worst:** Stock markets, geopolitics, mechanism-based medical diagnosis—domains where causal signals are weak but compelling stories are easy to generate.
