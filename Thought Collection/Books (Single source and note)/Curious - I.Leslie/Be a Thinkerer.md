"Thinkerer" is a portmanteau of think and tinker.

It's about combining thinking with experiments. Experiments are often reinforced by knowledge.

Steve Jobs was a thinkerer. The people responsible for our biggest ideas usually are details freak too.

It's easy in current society with the internet to skip and skim along the top line of everything. We need to make an effort to be thinkering.
