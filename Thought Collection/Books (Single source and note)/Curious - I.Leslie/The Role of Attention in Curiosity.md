Paying attention -> Then asking questions -> (leads to) things becoming more interesting

The transformative power of attention has the ability to turn anything interesting eventually. (Ward)

Ward is also an admirer of the French writer Georges Perec, who was interested in the infra-ordinary, which is the opposite of the extraordinary. Perec urged his readers to "question your teaspoons"

We can all find ways to make the mundane into something that stimulates our curiousity.
