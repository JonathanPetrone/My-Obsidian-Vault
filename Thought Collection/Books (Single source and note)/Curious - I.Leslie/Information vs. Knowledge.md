##### How do we differentiate between information and Knowledge?
###### **Information** = Raw Material
- **Raw data or facts** that exist externally or temporarily in our working memory
- **Easily searchable content** available through Google, Wikipedia, etc.
- **Short-term, surface-level content** that can be quickly accessed but not necessarily understood
- **Isolated pieces** that don't necessarily connect to anything else we know

###### **Knowledge** represents:
- **Information stored in long-term memory** that has been processed and connected
- **Networks of understanding** where facts link to other facts and concepts
- **The foundation for thinking** - what enables us to chunk complex problems and think efficiently
- **Cultural and experiential understanding** that enables pattern recognition and insight
