#### Puzzles vs. Mysteries

The author talks about Puzzles vs. Mysteries:
- Puzzles:
	- Have definite answer
	- Questions like, HOW MANY or WHERE?
	- Linked to goals
- Mysteries:
	- Indefinite answers
	- Questions like, WHY or HOW?
	- Linked to possibilities

We have a human bias towards puzzles, scientists operate around mysteries. Physicist Freeman Dyson has remarked that science is not a collection of truths, but “a continuing exploration of mysteries.”
