- "the use of skill and imagination to produce something new or to produce art" (Oxford Libraries)

Creativity often implies a guiding intention, even if it’s subtle or ambiguous.

## M. Csikszentmihalyi's thoughts
The problem is that the term “creativity” as commonly used covers too much ground.

Csikszentmihalyi's says that:
"Creativity is a process by which a symbolic domain in the culture is changed."

He also talks in his book about his [[System Model of Creativity]] which views the occurrence of creativity as interrelations of a system made up of three parts (The domain, the field and the person).

## Making connections
[[Creativity is the art of connecting things]]

### Asking ChatGPT: Can machines be creative?
In essence, while machines simulate creativity by producing novel, interesting, and even beautiful outputs, true creativity in the human sense involves **intentionality**, **emotional resonance**, and **intrinsic purpose—** qualities that machines, as of now, do not possess.

"Who is right: the individual who believes in his or her own creativity, or the social milieu that denies it? If we take sides with the individual, then creativity becomes a subjective phenomenon. All it takes to be creative, then, is an inner assurance that what I think or do is new and valuable." (M. Csikszentmihalyi,  Creativity Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention)
