Niklas Luhmann was a german Sociologist who had an unique system for working with notes, he put all his notes in a slip-boxes (Zettelkästen).

Luhmann used a bottom-up approach (see: [[Bottom-up approach and thinking]]) in his organization of notes and didn't start with broad over-arching categories, rather he indexed his notes by number and related notes got similar indexes. This created a kind of more "free" approach, where the future connections between information is of utmost importance. 

Luhmann took three types of notes:
- **Fleeting notes**, for catching spontaneous ideas. He didn't necessarily store or keep track of these notes but rather just to store the idea for later.
- **Literature notes**, whenever he read something, he made notes about the content. These he could store in a slip-box.
- **Permanent notes**, where his original ideas or combinations of information ended up which he stored in a separate slip-box.

Working this way enabled Luhmann to play with ideas and to look out for interesting connections and comparisons. He built clustersof notes, combined them with other clusters and preparedthe order of notes.

Working with the Zettelkasten method, lets us use the slip-boxes as long term memory resources, allowing us to free up our own mental resources. The itself slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers relevant notes, which it can make connections of which is what this method is all about.
