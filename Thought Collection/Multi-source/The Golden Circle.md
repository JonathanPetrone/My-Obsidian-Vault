The golden circle consists of three layers:

- **WHAT** - This is what you are doing
- **HOW** - How you are doing it
- **WHY** - Why you are doing it (notice that making money isn't seen as a ends to a mean but rather as a result)

Very few people/organizations communicate from their WHY. Simon Sinek argues that many inspirational people/organizations communicate from their WHY, instead of their WHAT.

By leaning on your WHY in communication and in different actions you take you have a bigger chance to inspire others.
