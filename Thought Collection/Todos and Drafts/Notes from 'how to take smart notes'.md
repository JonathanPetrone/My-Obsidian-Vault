#todo 
## Structure
- **A good structure enables flow**
- **A clear structure or restriction bolster creativity.**
- **The biggest threats to creativity and progress is a lack of structure and restrictions.**
-  **If you managed to structure your workflow according to the fact that writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about**
- **We should strategically build up new habits that have a chance to replace the old ones, not using extensive force to get there immediately.**

## Work flow
- **A smart working environment can help us avoid resistance**
- **Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward**
- **We need to try to structure our workflow in a way so that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward**
