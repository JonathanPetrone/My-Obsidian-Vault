### Leverage Points
 Leverage points are places in a system where a small change could lead to a large shift in behavior. Leverage points are points of power. Leverage points are frequently counterintuitive in their nature.

## Top to bottom ranking LPs from the book:
1. **Transcending Paradigms** 
	- The highest form of systems mastery involves letting go of the need to control through paradigms and instead developing the flexibility to work fluidly with whatever emerges. Here comes the The Paradox of Non-Attachment, most people resist this idea because it seems to offer no certainty or control. But those who embrace "not-knowing" discover it's actually radically empowering. You can choose whatever paradigm serves your purpose, you can "listen to the universe" for guidance when you lack direction, you're free from the limitations of any single worldview
2. **Paradigms**
	- Paradigms are the mindset out of which the system, its goals, structures, rules, delays, and parameters, arises. Paradigms are the fundamental, usually unstated assumptions about how the world works that everyone in a culture takes for granted - like "money measures worth" or "growth is good. By creating a model of a system forces you to step outside your current paradigm and see the whole system objectively. This external perspective can reveal assumptions you didn't know you held. 
3. **Goals** 
	- The goal of a system is a leverage point superior to self-organization of a system. If the goal is to bring more and more control of one particular central planning system (the Church, China, Walmart), everything else will be twisted to conform to that goal. People within systems don't recognize what whole-system goal they are serving. "to make profits" most companies would say, but thats just a rule or a necessary condition to stay in the game. What's the point of the game? To grow, to increase market share to bring everything under control and erase uncertainty. Changing the players in a system is a low-level intervention as long as the players fit into the old system. The exception is at the top where a single player can change the systems goal.
4. **Self-Organization** 
	- The most impressive thing living systems can do is to change themselves utterly by creating new structures and behaviors. Changing any aspect lower on this list is self-organization, it is part of system resilience. The intervention point here is obvious, but unpopular. Encouraging variability and experimentation and diversity means losing control. Let a thousand flowers bloom and anything could happen.

5. **Rules** 
	- The rules of a system defines its scope, its boundaries and its degree of freedom. If we try to imagine restructured rules and what our behavior would be under them we understand their power. They can be high leverage points. If you want to understand the deepest malfunctions of a system, pay attention to the rules and who has power over them. 
6. **Information Flows** 
	- Missing information flows is one of the most common causes of system malfunction. Adding or restoring information can be a powerful intervention, usually much easier and cheaper than rebuilding physical infrastructure. There is a systematic tendency on the part of human beings to avoid accountability for their own decisions. That’s why there are so many missing feedback loops—and why this kind of leverage point is so often popular with the masses, unpopular with the powers that be, and effective, if you can get the powers that be to permit it to happen (or go around them and make it happen anyway).
7. **Reinforcing Feedback Loops** 
	- A reinforcing feedback loop is self-reinforcing. The more it works, the more it gains power to work some more, driving system behavior in one direction. Reinforcing feedback loops are sources of growth, explosion, erosion, and collapse in systems. Look for leverage points around birth rates, interest rates, erosion rates, “success to the successful” loops, any place where the more you have of something, the more you have the possibility of having more.
8. **Balancing Feedback Loops**  
	- Information and control parts gives more leverage in a system. Balancing feedback loops are ubiquitous in systems. Nature evolves them and humans invent them. One mistake is to strip away those emergency response mechanisms because they are seldom used and often perceived to be expensive. The strength of the feedback loop is important relative to the impact it is designed to correct. If the impact increases in strength the feedback has too increase as well.
9. **Delays**   
	- Delays in feedback loops are critical determinants of system behavior. Delayed information or responses can cause overshooting as well as undershooting goals. However, delays are often not easily changeable, but if there are delays in the system that can be changed changing them can have huge effects.
10. **Stock and Flow Structures**   
	- Physical structure is crucial in a system, but it's rarely a leverage point, because changing it is rarely quick or simple. The leverage point is proper design in the first place. 
11. **Buffers** 
	- You can often stabilize a system by increasing the capacity of a buffer. Stores for example hold inventory instead of calling for new stock as the customer carries the old stock out of the store.
12. **Numbers - Constants & Parameters**
	- It's not that parameters aren't important they can be, especially in the short term, and to the individual standing directly in the flow. people care a lot about changing variables such as taxed, minimum wage. But changing this rarely changes the behavior of the national economy system.
