## Reading guide

There is a misconception in the world that you have to read a whole book from front to back. Actually, you don’t. Not at all. Follow these steps to learn all the most valuable lessons in a book in just one hour, without having to read the entire thing. 


Prepare to work through the book three times 

- **First time**, about 5 – 10 minutes, read the front cover and back cover. Read the introduction and the conclusion. Also read the contents. Just read them all, nice and quickly. Use a coloured pen or highlighter and highlight all the bits that interest you. All the golden nuggets of information. 

- **Second time**, take about 15 – 20 minutes. Read the first page of every chapter. Only the first page – if you see a story as the first thing, skip it, get to the meat. What are they saying? Most books can say their major points and lessons in just 10 or 20 pages. But they have to make a 200-word book for the publishers to sell it. So they fill it up with stories and repetition. Just find the main point of the chapter as quickly as you can. So you are mostly skimming. Use that coloured pen a lot to highlight the good bits. 

- **Third time**, about 30-35 minutes. Skim through the whole book. Only read the first sentence of each paragraph. No more. Stop reading! Write up a few notes – the main lessons from that book. Use a mind map.

Addition: 

Use a marker to mark so you remember good parts. You can gather the marked bits after you are done.
