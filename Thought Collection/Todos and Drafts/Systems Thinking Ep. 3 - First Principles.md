Epistemics -> Theory of Knowledge
	Modernism -> Objective reality & absolute truth
	Postmodernism -> Truths could not be generalized to Eastern, African, Asian cultural beliefs. "If I can't be the arbiter of truth then no one can"

First principles thinkers, like Elon Musk:
	Ask questions about foundational assumptions:
		Q: Why are rockets expensive?
		A: Because they are treated as disposable...
		Q: Well, what if you can reuse them?

Postmodernism when used correctly:
	Questions the Academic Establishment
	Questions the Status Quo
	Questions the Zeitgeist
	Questions the Conventional Wisdom
	Questions the Common Sense
	Questions the General Consensus

1. Unpack assumptions
	Familial, cultural, educational etc.
	Zoom out, look at temporal context and geographic context.
	Challenge assumptions and dogma.

2. Elegant simplicity
	"You don't truly understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother".
	Unless you can distill and reduce something to very simple, and easily defensible, axioms, or foundational assertions, you have not reached the bottom yet.

3. Cross pollination
	"Overspecialize and you breed in weakness".
	Many intellectual disciplines, are deliberately walled-off or "siloed".
	Study unrelated disciplines.
	
	Cross-train your brain! Become Transdisciplinary!

4. Analytical thirdspace
	"It is the mark of an educated mind to entertain an idea without accepting it".
	"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."
	
	Overcome cognitive dissonance!

5. Universal Principles
	Meaning -> Truths transcending a domain.
	Will be easier to discover through being transdisciplinary.
