An idea or product that deserves the label "creative" arises from the synergy of many sources and not only from the mind of a single person. It is easier to enhance creativity by changing conditions in the environment than by trying to make people think more creatively. And a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, comes after many years of hard work.

Reasons creativity are a central source of meaning in our lives.

Most of the things that are interesting, important and human are the results of creativity.

when we are involved in it we feel like we are living more fully than during the rest of life.

Creativity is a process by which a symbolic domain in the culture is changed.

(254)

Creativity requires surplus attention.

(269)

Creative people are neither single-minded, specialized, nor selfish. They love to make connections with adjacent areas of knowledge. They tend to be caring and sensitive. Yet the demands of their role inevitably push them toward specialization and selfishness. 

(301)

Creativity doesn't not happen inside people's heads, but in the interaction between a person's thoughts and a sociocultural context.

(529)

The problem is that the term creativity as commonly used covers too much ground.

Three different phenomena that can be called by creativity

- Bright people with unusual thoughts (the author refers to this category as brilliant rather than creative)
- People who experience the world in novel and original ways. (the author refers to this category as personally creative)
- People like Leonardo Da Vince, Picasso or Einstein (They are the creative ones without qualifications)

(560-575)

Two terms that are sometimes interchangeably used with creativity is talent and genius.

(599-606)

The systems model of Creativity. Creativity can be observed only in the interrelations of a system made up of three parts.

- The domain (consists of a set of symbolic rules and procedures)
- The field (which includes all the individuals who act as gatekeepers to the domain)
- The person (Creativity occurs when a person, using symbols of a given domain such as music, engineering, mathematics has a new idea or sees a new pattern, and when this novelty is selected by the appropriate field for inclusion in the relevant domain.)

So the definition of **Creativity** becomes: 

"Creativity is any act, idea, or product that changes an existing domain, or that transforms an existing domain into a new one."

A **creative person** is someone whose thoughts or actions change a domain, or establish a new domain.

(614-630)

Creativity in the systems model does not only depend on the individual persons creativity, but also the domain and the field.


For one thing, as I will try to show, an idea or product that deserves the label “creative” arises from the synergy of many sources and not only from the mind of a single person. It is easier to enhance creativity by changing conditions in the environment than by trying to make people think more creatively. And a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work.

Just as the sound of a tree crashing in the forest is unheard if nobody is there to hear it, so creative ideas vanish unless there is a receptive audience to record and implement them. And without the assessment of competent outsiders, there is no reliable way to decide whether the claims of a self-styled creative person are valid. According to this view, creativity results from the interaction of a system composed of three elements: a culture that contains symbolic rules, a person who brings novelty into the symbolic domain, and a field of experts who recognize and validate the innovation. All three are necessary for a creative idea, product, or discovery to take place.

The analogy to genes in the evolution of culture are memes, or units of information that we must learn if culture is to continue. Languages, numbers, theories, songs, recipes, laws, and values are all memes that we pass on to our children so that they will be remembered.

Therefore, to understand creativity it is not enough to study the individuals who seem most responsible for a novel idea or a new thing. Their contribution, while necessary and important, is only a link in a chain, a phase in a process.

Who is right: the individual who believes in his or her own creativity, or the social milieu that denies it? If we take sides with the individual, then creativity becomes a subjective phenomenon. All it takes to be creative, then, is an inner assurance that what I think or do is new and valuable.

Perhaps the most important implication of the systems model is that the level of creativity in a given place at a given time does not depend only on the amount of individual creativity. It depends just as much on how well suited the respective domains and fields are to the recognition and diffusion of novel ideas.

The existence of domains is perhaps the best evidence of human creativity. The fact that calculus and Gregorian chants exist means that we can experience patterns of order that were not programmed into our genes by biological evolution. By learning the rules of a domain, we immediately step beyond the boundaries of biology and enter the realm of cultural evolution.

Does this mean that a domain that is better structured—where creativity is easier to determine—is in some sense “better” than one that is more diffuse? That it is more important, more advanced, more serious? Not at all. If that were true, then chess, microeconomics, or computer programming, which are very clearly structured domains, would have to be considered more advanced than morality or wisdom.

Because of the scarcity of attention, we must be selective: We remember and recognize only a few of the works of art produced, we read only a few of the new books written, we buy only a few of the new appliances busily being invented. Usually it is the various fields that act as filters to help us select among the flood of new information those memes worth paying attention to.

To keep enjoying something, you need to increase its complexity. As Herodotus remarked, we cannot step in the same river twice.

Alfred Einstein always wore the same old sweater and baggy trousers. Why was he being so weird? Of course, Einstein wasn’t trying to upset anybody. He was just cutting down on the daily effort involved in deciding what clothes to wear, so that his mind could focus on matters that to him were more important. It may seem that choosing slacks and shirts takes so little time that it is pretentious to worry about it. But suppose it takes only two minutes each day to decide how to dress.

That adds up to 730 minutes, or twelve hours a year. Now think of the other repetitive things we have to do throughout the day—comb hair, drive cars, eat, and so on. And then think not only of the time it takes to do each of these things but of the interruption in the train of thought they cause, both before and after.

To change personality means to learn new patterns of attention. To look at different things, and to look at them differently; to learn to think new thoughts, have new feelings about what we experience.

Shift often from openness to closure. Perhaps the most important duality that creative persons are able to integrate is being open and receptive on the one hand, and focused and hard-driving on the other.

Aim for complexity. The ability to move from one trait to its opposite is part of the more general condition of psychic complexity. Complexity is a feature of every system, from the simplest amoeba to the most sophisticated human culture. When we say that something is complex we mean that it is a very differentiated system—it has many distinctive parts—and also that it is a very integrated system—the several parts work together smoothly.

Creative people are constantly surprised. They don’t assume that they understand what is happening around them, and they don’t assume that anybody else does either.

Creative people are constantly surprised. They don’t assume that they understand what is happening around them, and they don’t assume that anybody else does either. They question the obvious—not out of contrariness but because they see the shortcomings of accepted explanations before the rest of us do. They sense problems before they are generally perceived and are able to define what they are.

Try to produce unlikely ideas. Originality is one of the hallmarks of creative thinking. If asked to come up with names for a baby, or ways to use a paper clip, or things to do at a party, a creative person is likely to give answers that are different from the answers of the majority.

There are two dangers as you become involved in a domain. The first is addiction; some domains are so seductive that you may invest so much attention into it that you have none left for your job and family.
