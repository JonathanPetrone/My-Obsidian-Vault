## Systems are made up of:
- **Elements**
	- These are often the least important in defining the unique characteristics of a system
- **Interconnections**
	- These often operate through the flow of information
- **Functions/Purposes**
	- Often the best way to discover these are observing the system.
	- Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals.
	- Systems can have nested systems and thus nested purposes.
	- Functions or purposes is often most determinant in a systems behavior.

#### Examples of a systems inherent characteristics/traits:
- Adaptive
- Dynamic
- Goal-seeking
- Self-perserving
- Evolutionary behavior

## Foundations
- **Stock**
	- Stocks are the foundation of any system, they are te element of the system that you can see, feel, count, or measure. A stock doesn't have to be physical.
	- A stock takes time to change because flows needs time to flow.
	- Stocks allow inflows and outflows to be decoupled and to be independent.
- **Flow**
	- From and to stocks there are flows. I.e inflow and outflow.

Humans tend to focus more on stocks than on flows, on top of that also there is a bias towards inflows over outflows.

System thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks along with mechanisms for regulating the levels in stocks by manipulating flow. (Skeptical about his, what does this mean exactly, seems overly reductionistic)

Feedback loops can cause stocks to maintain their level within a range or grow and decline. There usually is monitoring done by someone or something, that starts a corrective process. This can mean adjusting inflow or outflow or changing the stock level. 

Feedback loop type examples:
- Stabilizing loop
- Reinforcing loop

However not all systems have feedback loops.
