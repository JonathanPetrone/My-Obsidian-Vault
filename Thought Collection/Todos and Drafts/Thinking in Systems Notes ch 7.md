System thinking can lead us to believe that we have or will have more control or predictive power. We can never fully understand our world not in the way our reductionist science has led us to expect.

## Lessons from the book 
#### Get the Beat of the System
Before you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves. If possible, find or make a time graph of actual data from the system—peoples’ memories are not always reliable when it comes to timing. It’s amazing how many misconceptions there can be. People will swear that rainfall is decreasing, say, but when you look at the data, you find that what is really happening is that variability is increasing—the droughts are deeper, but the floods are greater too. 

The common and distracting tendency we all have to define a problem not by the system’s actual behavior, but by the lack of our favorite solution.
#### Expose Your Mental Models to the Light of Day
Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own.
#### Honor, Respect, and Distribute Information
You’ve seen how information holds systems together and how delayed, biased, scattered, or missing information can make feedback loops malfunction. Decision makers can’t respond to information they don’t have, can’t respond accurately to information that is inaccurate, and can’t respond in a timely way to information that is late.

Information is power. Anyone interested in power grasps that idea very quickly. The media, the public relations people, the politicians, and advertisers who regulate much of the public flow of information.
#### Use Language with Care and Enrich It with Systems Concepts
The first step in respecting language is keeping it as concrete, meaningful, and truthful as possible—part of the job of keeping information streams clear. The second step is to enlarge language to make it consistent with our enlarged understanding of systems. If the Eskimos have so many words for snow, it’s because they have studied and learned how to use snow. They have turned snow into a resource, a system with which they can dance.
#### Pay Attention to What Is Important, Not Just What Is Quantifiable
Our culture, obsessed with numbers, has given us the idea that what we can measure is more important than what we can’t measure. Pretending that something doesn’t exist if it’s hard to quantify leads to faulty models. You’ve already seen the system trap that comes from setting goals around what is easily measured, rather than around what is important.
#### Make Feedback Policies for Feedback Systems
You can imagine why a dynamic, self-adjusting feedback system cannot be governed by a static, unbending policy. It’s easier, more effective, and usually much cheaper to design policies that change depending on the state of the system. Especially where there are great uncertainties, the best policies not only contain feedback loops, but meta-feedback loops—loops that alter, correct, and expand loops. These are policies that design learning into the management process.
#### Go for the Good of the Whole
Remember that hierarchies exist to serve the bottom layers, not the top. Don’t maximize parts of systems or subsystems while ignoring the whole. Don’t, as Kenneth Boulding once said, go to great trouble to optimize something that never should be done at all. Aim to enhance total systems properties, such as growth, stability, diversity, resilience, and sustainability—whether they are easily measured or not.
#### Listen to the Wisdom of the System
Aid and encourage the forces and structures that help the system run itself. Notice how many of those forces and structures are at the bottom of the hierarchy. Don’t be an unthinking intervenor and destroy the system’s own self-maintenance capacities. Before you charge in to make things better, pay attention to the value of what’s already there.
#### Locate Responsibility in the System
Systems should be designed so that feedback about consequences flows directly, quickly, and compellingly to the people making decisions. This creates natural accountability without external enforcement. An airplane pilot sits in the front of the plane, so they immediately experience the results of their flying decisions - creating intrinsic responsibility for safe operation.

Modern society has moved away from designing systems with intrinsic responsibility, creating distance between decision-makers and consequences (like remote warfare via button-pushing).
#### Stay Humble— Stay a Learner
The thing to do, when you don’t know, is not to bluff and not to freeze, but to learn. The way you learn is by experiment. Error-embracing is the condition for learning. It means seeking and using—and sharing—information about what went wrong with what you expected or hoped would go right. Both error embracing and living with high levels of uncertainty emphasize our personal as well as societal vulnerability.
#### Celebrate Complexity
We can, and some of us do, celebrate and encourage self-organization, disorder, variety, and diversity. 
#### Expand Time Horizons
In a strict systems sense, there is no long term, short-term distinction. Phenomena at different time-scales are nested within each other. Actions taken now have some immediate effects and some that radiate out for decades to come. We experience now the consequences of actions set in motion yesterday and decades ago and centuries ago. The couplings between very fast processes and very slow ones are sometimes strong, sometimes weak. When the slow ones dominate, nothing seems to be happening; when the fast ones take over, things happen with breathtaking speed. Systems are always coupling and uncoupling the large and the small, the fast and the slow.
#### Defy the Disciplines
In spite of what you majored in, or what the textbooks say, or what you think you’re an expert at, follow a system wherever it leads. It will be sure to lead across traditional disciplinary lines. To understand that system, you will have to be able to learn from—while not being limited by—economists and chemists and psychologists and theologians.
#### Expand the Boundary of Caring
Living successfully in a world of complex systems means expanding not only time horizons and thought horizons; above all, it means expanding the horizons of caring. There are moral reasons for doing that, of course. And if moral arguments are not sufficient, then systems thinking provides the practical reasons to back up the moral ones. The real system is interconnected. No part of the human race is separate either from other human beings or from the global ecosystem.
#### Don’t Erode the Goal of Goodness
We know what to do about drift to low performance. Don’t weigh the bad news more heavily than the good. And keep standards absolute.

Systems thinking can only tell us to do that. It can’t do it. We’re back to the gap between understanding and implementation. Systems thinking by itself cannot bridge that gap, but it can lead us to the edge of what analysis can do and then point beyond—to what can and must be done by the human spirit.
