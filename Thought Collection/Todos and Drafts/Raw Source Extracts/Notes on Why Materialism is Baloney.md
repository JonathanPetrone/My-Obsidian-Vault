### The Current Worldview and its Implications

Yet, it is quite clear to any diligent commentator on Western culture that there is, indeed, a subtle but irresistible core of ideas and beliefs – **a core worldview – that holds more influence than any other in our society;** even among those people who, outwardly, declare their allegiance to different belief systems. I am speaking, of course, of Western materialism.

**Materialism subtly pervades our expectations, value systems, goals, and nearly every aspect of our lives.**

The point I am trying to make is that, while acknowledging that there are many superficial worldviews operating simultaneously in society, there is a powerful core worldview that subtly pervades the deepest, often ‘subconscious’ levels of our minds, ultimately determining how we truly feel about ourselves and reality. This core worldview is materialism. Many of us absorb materialist beliefs from the culture without even being aware of it, all the while trusting that we hold other beliefs.

The power of the core materialist worldview comes from its adoption by intellectual elites and its amplification by the mainstream media. Social validation is often crucial to our ability to truly hold onto a belief system, both consciously and ‘subcon-sciously.’

*Materialism and science* 
**Having said all the above, it is important to keep in mind the difference between materialism as a metaphysics and scientific theories as models. Many people – including many scientists – easily confuse the two, mistakenly construing the empirical evidence collected from nature through the scientific method to lend direct support to the materialist metaphysics.**

But **our ability to model the patterns and regularities of reality tells us little about the underlying nature of things. Scientific modeling is useful for informing us how one thing or phenomenon relates to another thing or phenomenon – this being precisely what mathematical equations do – but it cannot tell us what these things or phenomena fundamentally are in and by themselves. The reason is simple: science can only explain one thing in terms of another thing; it can only explicate and characterize a certain phenomenon in terms of its relative differences with respect to another phenomenon.**

Capturing the observable patterns and regularities of the elements of reality, relative to each other, is an empirical and scientific question. But pondering about the fundamental nature of these elements is not; it is a philosophical question. The problem is that, **in recent decades, scientists who have little or no understanding of philosophy have begun to believe that science alone can replace philosophy.**

Scientific modeling requires little or no understanding of the underlying nature of reality in exactly the same way that a gamer needs little or no understanding of the computer’s underlying architecture in order to win the game.

I hope to show you that much of what we are told to believe is based on unexamined and unjustified assumptions and biases, some of them preposterous. Much of what society at large takes to be the ‘hard, cold facts of life’ is, in reality, ungrounded supposition and abstraction, much of it flying in the face of reason, parsimony and lucid observation.

The most basic assertion of materialism is that reality is, well, exclusively material.8 Materialism asserts that reality exists outside your mind in the form of assemblies of material particles occupying the framework of space-time.

That there is such a thing as consciousness is, according to materialism, a product of chance configurations of matter, driven mechanically by the pressures of natural selection.

**Indeed, materialism holds that consciousness is itself a phenomenon produced, and entirely explainable, by the assembly of material particles that we call a brain.**

How the mechanical movements of particles are accompanied by inner life is a question left unanswered by materialism. After all, just like in the case of computers, all the ‘calculations’ taking place inside our brains could, in principle, just happen ‘in the dark,’ completely unaccompanied by inner experience. This question is known as the ‘hard problem of consciousness,’10 or the ‘explanatory gap.’11 In its 125th anniversary edition, Science magazine listed the ‘hard problem’ as the second most important unanswered question in science.12 It should have been the first.

But when it comes to consciousness, nothing allows us to deduce the properties of subjective experience – the redness of red, the bitterness of regret, the warmth of fire – from the mass, momentum, spin, charge, or any other property of subatomic particles bouncing around in the brain. This is the hard problem of consciousness.

Under materialism, if you cannot explain consciousness in terms of emerging dynamics of unconscious subatomic particles, you must then postulate that consciousness is itself a fundamental property – like electric charge, mass or spin – of all particles.21 So you must believe that all arrangements of matter – from single subatomic particles, to windmills, to electronic devices – are conscious in different degrees. This is another ‘hidden’ implication of materialism that most people are not aware of, and it entails an unfathomable explosion of conscious entities in nature. **The problem with panpsychism is, of course, that there is precisely zero evidence that any inanimate object is conscious.**

Therefore, there is indeed good empirical justification for the inference that other people and animals, and perhaps even all life forms, are conscious. But there is no empirical justification to infer that inanimate objects, which manifest no external behaviors that anyone could possibly relate to one’s own inner experience, are conscious in any way or to any degree whatsoever. As such, the only possible reason to believe in panpsychism is to make materialism work.

The current materialist view in neuroscience is that the ordinary, waking reality we experience every day is in fact a brain-constructed ‘hallucination’ analogous in nearly every way to a dream.

According to materialism, what we experience in our lives every day is not reality as such, but a kind of brain-constructed ‘copy’ of reality. Everything we see, hear, or otherwise perceive is supposedly a complex amalgamation of electrochemical signals unfolding in a kind of theater inside our skulls.


Why does materialism depart so drastically from everyday intuition? Because it must, if it is to remain internally consistent. If all that exists is matter, and if consciousness is somehow produced by the suitable arrangement of matter represented by the brain, then it must be the case that all subjective perception resides in the brain; and in the brain only. Thus, according to materialism, the only way you can experience a world outside your head is if signals from that outside world penetrate your brain via the sense organs and, then, somehow modulate the creation of a brain-constructed hallucination that corresponds to the outside world.

As such, all Western science and philosophy, ancient and modern, from Greek atomism to quantum mechanics, from Democritus and Aristotle to Bohr and Popper, must have been and still be fundamentally limited to the partial and distorted ‘copy’ of reality in our brains that materialism implies. **As such, materialism is somewhat self-defeating. After all, the materialist worldview is the result of an internal model of reality whose unreliability is an inescapable implication of that very model. In other words, if materialism is right, then materialism cannot be trusted. If materialism is correct, then we may all be locked in a small room trying to explain the entire universe outside by looking through a peephole on the door; availing ourselves only of the limited and distorted images that come through it.**

a way of thinking – which others can perhaps build upon in the longer-term project of constructing a robust philosophical system to replace materialism with.

### Tackling the Mind-Body Problem

By postulating that subjective experiences are neural processes, the reigning materialist paradigm tentatively explains the ordinary correlations between mind states and brain states rather simply. Yet, this paradigm is currently articulated in only a vague and promissory manner, in that neuroscience does not specify precisely or unambiguously what measurable parameters of neural processes map onto what qualities of subjective experience.

experience. If materialism is correct, there always has to be a strict one-to-one correspondence between parameters measured from the outside and the qualities of what is experienced form the inside. After all, subjective experience supposedly is what is measured from the outside. For instance, if I see the color red, there have to be measurable parameters of the corresponding neural process in my brain that are always associated with the color red. After all, my experience of seeing red supposedly is the neural process. Similarly, **if I feel sad, there have to be measurable parameters of the corresponding neural process in my brain that are always associated with the feeling of sadness. After all, my experience of being sad supposedly is the neural process. You get the picture. As I mentioned above, neuroscience today is very far from being able to provide a consistent one-to-one mapping between the qualities of a subjective experience and measurable parameters of the corresponding neural process.** It is possible to argue that this merely reflects our currently limited progress in finding this mapping and that it will be found in the future as more research is done and new techniques are developed for measuring the finer parameters of brain activity. As a vague and promissory argument, this is unfalsifiable. But **we should keep two things in mind: first, decades of research and very high investments have already been made in the pursuit of this mapping, so it’s not like we’ve just started. Second, much of what we have found thus far seems to contradict the notion that there is any such consistent one-to-one mapping.**

It is indeed known in neuroscience that consciousness is often correlated with interplay between excitatory and inhibitory processes. But that does not mean that one cannot expect local proportionality between an experience and the particular subset of neural activity that is the experience, whether there is inhibition going on around it or not. Obviously, the experience and that particular subset of neural activity should be proportional because, according to materialism, they are the same thing! And this is what specificity seems to throw out the window: if any subjective experience, regardless of complexity or intensity, can be any neural process, regardless of the number of neurons or firings involved, it becomes very difficult to see how the qualities of the experience can, in some way, be proportional to parameters of the neural process. And if it isn’t proportional, then clearly it cannot be the neural process!

specificity does not spare materialists of the obligation to show a one-to-one, proportional mapping between the qualities of an experience and measurable parameters of the particular neural process that supposedly is the experience.

**Tononi’s theory states that conscious experience is a result of how much information is integrated by a purely material brain process.** The theory takes as input what Tononi calls ‘complexes’: closed-cycle neural processes in the brain, each entailing a given anatomic organization. The amount of information integrated by a complex, represented by the variable ? (pronounced ‘phi,’ as in ‘Phi Beta Kappa’), is then calculated for each complex based on its anatomic organization. The idea is that, when ? crosses a certain threshold, the complex somehow becomes conscious. The specific value of this threshold is determined through empirical calibration. When the calibration is reliable, researchers can then predict which neural processes are conscious simply by looking at the corresponding ? value.45

What determines this magical threshold for ?? Where is consciousness coming from? Why does sufficient information integration lead to the extraordinary and discontinuous phenomenon of otherwise unconscious neurons suddenly lighting up with consciousness?

**Tononi’s theory provides merely a heuristic indicator for the presence of consciousness, an ad hoc rule-of-thumb. ? is like the needle of a speedometer and it explains consciousness no more than a speedometer explains how a car moves: when the needle of the speedometer moves up, one knows that the car is moving.**

Since Tononi’s theory is claimed, by materialists, to be the best materialism has to offer, it is fair to conclude that, contrary to the impression often given by mainstream media, materialism currently does not offer an explanatory framework for tackling the mind-body problem.

the. logical consequence is that consciousness cannot be reduced to matter –for it appears that it is needed for matter to exist in the first place – but mustitself be fundamental. From a philosophical perspective, this notion is entirely coherent and reasonable, for conscious experience is all we can be certain to exist. Entities outside consciousness are, as far as we can ever know, merely abstractions of mind. Taking consciousness to be an ontological primitive also circumvents the ‘explanatory gap’ and the ‘hard problem of consciousness,’ since both only arise from the attempt to reduce consciousness to matter.

if consciousness is primary and irreducible, it cannot be the case that the brain generates it. How can we then explain the empirical observation that, ordinarily, mind states correlate well to brain states? **The hypothesis I submit is that the function of the brain is to localize consciousness, pinning it to the space-time reference point implied by the physical body. In doing so, the brain modulates conscious perception in accordance with the perspective of the body.**

***The predictions of the filter hypothesis***
**First, the filter hypothesis implies that consciousness, in its unfiltered state, is unbound. As such, consciousness must be fundamentally unitary and non-individualized, for separateness and individualization entail boundaries.**

the filter hypothesis, unlike materialism, predicts **the existence of a ‘collective uncon-scious;’** a shared repository of potential experiences that far transcends mere genetic predispositions of a species. It is conceivable that, either through natural fluctuations or intentional interference with the filtering mechanisms that modulate our individual experiences, parts of this ‘collective unconscious’ can occasionally penetrate awareness. Secondly, and most importantly, **the filter hypothesis predicts that one can have experiences that do not correlate with one’s brain state**s. Since here the brain is seen merely as a mechanism for filtering out experiences, it is conceivable that, when this mechanism is interfered with so as to be partially or temporarily deactivated, one’s subjective experience could delocalize, expand beyond the body in time and space, and perhaps even beyond time and space as such. In other words, the filter hypothesis predicts that transpersonal, non-local experiences can conceivably happen when particular brain processes are partially or temporarily deactivated. This possibility, of course, is excluded by the materialist worldview.

**Jung found that mental contents from the ‘collective unconscious’ can penetrate consciousness through dreams, visions, and other non-ordinary states.**

This and countless other examples motivated Jung to postulate that there is a part of mind – shared by all human beings, and perhaps by all conscious beings – which is extremely rich in images and narratives. Ordinarily, these collective images and narratives are ‘filtered out’ of ordinary awareness. However, under certain conditions, they can penetrate consciousness.

**Psychedelic substances have been known to induce highly complex, intense, non-local, transpersonal experiences.61 It had always been assumed that they did so by exciting the parts of the brain correlated with such experiences. Yet, a recent study has shown that psychedelics actually do the opposite.**

**In other words, the intensity of the experience was inversely proportional to the activation of the brain, precisely as predicted by the filter hypothesis.**

The pattern here is not only clear, but striking. The most complex, coherent, intense, non-local, and transpersonal experiences people report are associated precisely with reductions, or even elimination, of brain activity. This

extracted. While particular reports of transpersonal experiences could possibly be explained away, the broad pattern that associates peak transpersonal experiences with reductions of brain activity clearly points to a robust and consistent phenomenon. And it is a phenomenon that cannot be explained under a materialist metaphysics.

## Chapter 3

### Mind as the Medium of Reality

What is mind? The most natural and obvious answer to this ancient question is simply this: **mind is the medium of everything you have ever known, seen or felt; everything that has ever meant anything to you. Whatever has never fallen within the embrace of your mind might as well have never existed as far as you are concerned.**

The part of the materialist worldview that entails that objects exist outside, and independently, of mind is called realism.86 To Western ears, realism is a very intuitive metaphysics: objects possess an undeniable concreteness and continuity that suggests their autonomous existence outside ourselves. But realism is not the only metaphysics that has been proposed by philosophers over the ages. There is another alternative called idealism: the notion that all reality is a phenomenon of, and in, mind.87 To idealists, there is only the medium of mind and its contents.88 Everything you see, hear, feel, think, or otherwise cognize right now exists, to an idealist, only insofar as it unfolds in mind. There is no abstract external world outside mind. We can summarize it thus: **Realism: Reality exists outside and independent of mind; Idealism: Reality consists exclusively of mind and its contents.**

The key implications of idealism It is easier to build my case for idealism if you have, since early on, a good understanding of what its implications are. The most important implication is this: if idealism is correct, then mind is not within the brain, because it is the brain that is within mind. If you recall our discussion in Chapter 2, **this inversion of the relationship between brain and mind sounds promising as a potential explanation for transpersonal experiences**, an idea we will explore in more details in Chapter 4.

Notice that, when I say that everything exists in mind, I am not implying that everything exists in someone’s head. My hypothesis is that your head is in mind, not mind in your head. Mind is not bound or circumscribed by any physical structure, because all physical structures arise in mind. Like any other object you perceive, your own body is a product of mind in much the same way that a dreamed-up body in a nightly dream is a product of your dreaming mind.

One mind Western education and culture take for granted that mind is personal and discontinuous across people – that is, that your mind is entirely your own and fundamentally separate from everybody else’s minds. Yet, if idealism is true and all reality is indeed in mind, then the simplest hypothesis is that there is but one mind; one irreducible medium in which the dance of existence unfolds. Otherwise, one would have to postulate that mind has arisen irreducibly countless times in nature, once for every conscious being. This is, of course, a tremendously inflationary postulate. So we will stick to the most parsimonious alternative: there is but one irreducible medium of mind, the sole ontological primitive of all reality.

**Your egoic mind – that limited awareness you identify yourself with – is, in this context, merely a segment of the broad, universal canvas of mind.**

Idealism entails that, like a dream, reality exists only insofar as it is in mind, but not that everything in it is conscious and has an inner life of its own. For instance, while acknowledging that other living entities are conscious – that is, while granting validity to statement 2 discussed earlier – I do not subscribe to the notion that rocks, windmills, home thermostats, or computers are conscious and have their own subjective points-of-view. Technically

Instead, what idealism is saying is precisely that there is no stuff. There is only subjective perception. The word ‘stuff’ is just a way to describe certain modalities and regularities of perception.

According. to idealism, all stuff – all materials, objects, etc. – exist only insofar as they are subjectively apprehended in mind. The substrate of mind itself is not stuff: it is the subject, not an object. It is the medium from which perceptions arise, but is itself not perceivable for exactly the same reason that the eye that sees cannot see itself without a mirror; or – as Alan Watts put it – that you can’t bite your own teeth.96 As such, the substrate of mind cannot be measured, detected, or analyzed like some kind of stuff, because it is that which measures, detects, and analyzes in the first place. **The substrate of mind is not a material, but that which imagines all materials.** Do you see what I am trying to say? If not, no worries: this will become a lot clearer and more explicit in Chapter 6.

**We tend to tile the entire world around us with an intricate web of concepts derived from language. We live inside a self-woven conceptual cocoon that insulates us from raw reality.** **Studies have shown, for instance, that people whose languages categorize colors differently from our Western languages actually see colors very differently too.**

## Chapter 4 + Chapter 5

### The brain as a knot of mind

**Core argument:** The brain doesn't _generate_ consciousness—it's a localized _pattern_ or "knot" in a broader field of consciousness. Like a whirlpool in a stream (the whirlpool isn't separate from water, it's a self-sustaining pattern _in_ water), individual minds are stable patterns in universal consciousness.

### A mercurial metaphor

**Core argument:** Extends the dissociation metaphor using mercury/quicksilver. Pour mercury on a surface, it fragments into separate droplets that appear isolated but are same substance. Recombine them and boundaries disappear instantly.

## Chapter 6
### The oscillating membrane metaphor

**Core argument:** Introduces dynamic model of ego/self boundary. Not a static wall but an oscillating membrane that flexibly expands/contracts.

**Key mechanisms:**

- Normal waking: membrane tightly contracted (strong self/other distinction)
- Sleep/dreams: membrane loosens (why dreams feel less "you" directed)
- Meditation/flow states: controlled membrane expansion
- Psychosis: membrane collapse or rigidity
- Death: membrane dissolution

### Re-interpreting reality
**Key insight:** Many philosophical problems are artifacts of dualism or materialism. They're not _solved_ under idealism—they're _reframed_ as non-problems or differently structured problems.
