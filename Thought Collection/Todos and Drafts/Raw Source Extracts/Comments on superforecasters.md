CH1 - An Optimistic Skeptic
%%(Believing we can predict the future with complete information)%%
%%(Linked to earlier perspective)%%
%%(Prediction is still useful)%%
%%(It's complicated to make predictions)%%
%%(check accuracy for incremental improvement to get better)%%
%%(Foresight can be learned)%%
%%(Foresight mindset)%%
%%(Computer + Human cooperation)%%

CH2 - Illusions of Knowledge
%%(Jumping to conclusions without enough doubt)%%
%%(experiments, measurement + statistics)%%
%%(systems 1 + 2)%%
%%(More details on system 1)%%
%%(split-brain patients making things up as reasons, example of stock market analysts)%%
%%(doubt and system 1 + 2)%%
%%(when faced with a hard question, we often surreptitiously replace it with an easy one)%%
%%(Fire commanders dealing with complex situations due to pattern recognition)%%
%%(Forecasting in twenty-first century )%%

CH3  - Keeping Store
%% Uncertainty what is actually predicted to happen, and when%%
%% Estimations, rather than prediction in forecasting%%
%%Meaning and interpretation of words, serious possibility%%
%% On assigning probablities%%
%% Necessity of defined terms and timelines%%
%% Forecasts and Brier Scores%%
%%One vs. many perspectives in forecasting%%
%%One vs. many perspectives in forecasting - on hedgehogs vs. foxes%%
%% wisdom of crowds ?%%
%% aggregating with useful knowledge -> fox perspective%%
%% Dragonfly eyes and a fox%%
%% The model fox/hedgehog is not a dichotomy%%

CH4 - Superforecasters
%%There should be accountability for process not outcome%%
%%wisdom of the crowd knowledge spread%%
%%superforecasters excellence%%
%%hard to mirror successful results/predictions, what is luck and not?%%
%% Regression to the mean is a effective tool for evaluating performance%%

CH5 - Supersmart?
%%Intelligence and knowledge is not everything but a good contributor%%
%%Fermi-mizing method%%
%%Hidden assumptions when answering, could be somoene else poisoning Arafat%% 
%%Outside view vs inside view%%
%% A good statistic is a good anchor%%
%% Fermi-ization of inside view%%
%% Perspectives to synthesize after outside and inside view%%
%%Openness to expierence is present in superforecasters%%
%% beliefs are hypotheses to be tested %%

CH6 - Superquants?
%% Many superforecasters have backgrounds in math, science etc.%%
%%numeracy helps forecasters%%
%%nothing is ever 100% %%
%% we want answers %% 
%% overstimation of correlation of confidence and accuracy%%
%% Science is never 100% certainty %%
%% More granularity is preferred in predicitons%%
%% Challenging assumptions of it "had to be" %%
%% Meaning is negatively correlated with foresight %%

CH7 - Supernewsjunkies?
%%The process of superforecasting%%
%% change/update predictions %%
%% Attention and careful initial forecasts%%
%% update when it is more likely etc.%%
%% Make sure you are answering the right question %%
%% belief perserverance%%
%% less investment in pride is good for outcome %%
%% Make judgment on the information%%
%% commitment to beliefs%%
%% the key to good forecasting is not to overreact or underreact to new information%%
%%On Tim (superforecaster) updates on forecast, modest changes but frequent%%
%% bayes theorem and updating often%%
%%example of bayes theorem%%
%%on capturing the essence of bayes theorem%%

CH8 - Perpetual Beta
%% growth mindset importance of%%
%% the importance of doing %%
%% on tacit knowledge and bruising experience%%
%%good, clear and timely feedback from practice is needed%%
%% two reasons why many forecasters dont get good feedback %%
%%importance of clear language%%
%%admit failure when off%%
%% be curious regarding improving %%
%%grit is important%%
%% Traits for superforecasters%%

CH9 - Superteams
%% Consensus is not good for forecasting in groups%%
%% Success can make us question less, also not good for forecasting%%
%% Constructive criticism%%
%% "Our" vs "my" focus%%
%% Givers are important, especially groups with many of them can have great results %%

CH10 - The Leader's Dilemma
%% The divide between leader and forecaster traits doesn't have to be incompatible%%
%% Top-down vs more shared decision power%%
%% More shared decision power makes for more effective actions%%
%% Leaders must be both doers and thinkers%%
%% Freedom with a clear mission%%
%% Intelligent humility is very important for good judgment%%

CH11 - Are They Really So Super?
%%Tinkering with the question and understanding the scope of a question is important%%
%%Black swans are maybe just gray?%%
%% 9/11 wasnt the first time anyone hijacked something to crash it, so was it really a black swan? %%
%% Some events are so unlikely we wont see them,  it may take decades or centuries or millennia to pile up enough data%%
%% In retrospect we put all things together that happen in a chain of events after the planes, creating the black swan we speak of today, maybe a chain of very unlikely events that conspired and some of them could have been forecasted in isolation%%
%%The point is that we are more volatile then is to maybe be belived%%

CH12 - What's Next?
%%Asking for better forecasting processes%%
%%The goal of the actors matter a lot, sometimes accuracy is not the goal%%
%%Being percentage based risks blame%%
%%Numbers are tool, not divine insight%%
%%Think and de-construct questions, are they big or small?%%
%%On changing your mind QUOTE%%
