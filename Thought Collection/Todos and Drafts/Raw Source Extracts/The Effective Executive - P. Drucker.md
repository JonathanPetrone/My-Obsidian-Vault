## Introduction

Effective executives:
- Asks "What needs to be done?"
- Asks "What is right for the enterprise?"
- They develop action plans
- They take responsibility for actions
- They take responsibility for communicating
- They focus on opportunities rather than problems
- They have productive meetings
- They think and say "we" rather than "I"

"What needs to be done?" almost always contains more than one urgent task. But effective executives do not splinter themselves, they focus on one task at a time if possible.

Time is the executives scarcest and most precious resource, organizations are inherently time wasters. The action plan developed by the executive should be efficient in making the executive spend his time as to not waste it. The action plan is a statement of intentions rather than commitments.

#### Acting
A decision has not been made until people know: 
- Who is accountable for carrying it out?
- What is the deadline?
- Who is the affected people, and do they understand and agree with it?
- Who are the people that needs to be informed by this decision?

---

Executives owe it to the organization not to tolerate nonperforming individuals in important jobs.

Organizations are held together by information rather than ownership or commands. The executive needs to identify the information he needs, ask for it, and keep pushing until he gets it.

Good executives focus on opportunities, for them change equals opportunity.

Executives put the best people on opportunities rather than problems.

#### Good meetings:
- Stick to format
- End as soon as the goal is met
- Sum up an adjourn

### Questions:
- How can I devise my own action plan?
- How can I make sure I focus on opportunities?

## Chapter 1 - Effectiveness Can Be Learned

An executive is expected to get the right things done. The manual worker can always be judged in terms of the quantity and quality of a definable and discrete output.

Working on the right thing is what makes knowledge work effective. The knowledge worker  cannot be supervised closely or in detail. He must also direct himself.

If effectiveness is lacking in his work his commitment to work and contribution will soon wither.

The knowledge worker does not produce a physical product, he produces knowledge, ideas, and information. Another man of knowledge has to turn his idea into input for his output.

The knowledge worker must provide effectiveness.

### Who is an Executive?
Every knowledge worker in a modern organization is an executive if, by virtue of his position. or knowledge he is responsible for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the organization to perform an obtain results.

Such a man or woman must make decisions, he can't just carry out orders. He must take responsibility for his contributions.

Knowledge work is defined by its results.

What the executive needs, are criteria which allows him to work on what is important. The executive is effective only if and when other people make use of what he contributes.

A fact is something someone defined, classified, and, above all has endowed with relevance.

#### Effective Executives:
1. Know where their time goes
2. Focus on outward contribution
3. Builds on strengths
4. Set priorities, focus on what's most important
5. Make effective decisions, what is needed are few but fundamental decisions.

### Questions: 
- How can I produce something that is better input for someone else's output?
- Can I make a system for effective execution?

## Chapter 2 - Know Thy Time

Effective executives are:
- Recording time
- Managing time
- Consolidating time

Since the knowledge workers direct himself, he must understand what is expected from him.

One cannot think of managing time before first knowing where it goes.
#### Systematic time management
1. Identify what does not need to be done and stop doing it.
2. Which things that I currently do could be done by others?
3. Do I waste others time?
	1. Ask what I do that takes time without contributing to your effectiveness?

#### Pruning Time-wasters
1. Identify time-wasters that come from lack of a system or foresight
2. Is the workforce too big?
	1. Lean organizations have fewer role collisions
3. Excess of meetings
4. Malfunction of information

Time is the scarcest resource and unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed.

### Questions
- Do I do things that does not need to be done?
- How can I better understand what is expected from me?


## Chapter 3 - What Can I Contribute?

The effective executive focuses on contribution.

He asks:
- What can I contribute that will significantly affect the performance and the results of the institution I serve?

Without this you are likely to aim too low or for the wrong things.

The executives who sets his sights on contribution raises his standards and the standards of everyone with whom he works.

You should be willing to change with the demands of a new position.

The task is not to breed generalists, it is to enable the specialist to make himself and his specialty effective. The knowledge worker is usually a specialist.

If a man wants to be a executive he has to concern himself with the usability of his "product" -- that is his knowledge.

Ask:
- What contribution do you need from me to make your contribution to the organization?
	- When do you need this?
	- How do you need it?
	- In what form?

Executives in an organization does not have good human relations because they have a "talent for people". They focus on contribution in their own work and in relationship with others.

Those who take responsibility in their contribution will demand their subordinates to take responsibility too.

Ask also:
- Who has to use my output for it to become effective?

Asking about the most important contribution I can make to the performance asks in effect "What self-development do I need?"

People in general, and knowledge workers in particular, grow according to the demands they make on themselves.

Effective executives know what they expect to get out of a meeting, a report, or a presentation.
	- They ask "Why" or "What do we want here?" 

### Questions
- What can I contribute that will significantly affect the performance of the organization I serve?

## Chapter 4 - Making Strength Productive

Don't build on weakness, build on strength. Be mindful though that strong people have strong weaknesses too.

Effective executives never ask "How does he get along with me?". Their question is always: "What can he do uncommonly well?"

"One cannot hire a hand -- the whole man always comes with it", says a proverb of the human relations people.

Jobs have to be objective; that is, determined by task rather than by personality.

To structure a job to a person is almost certain to result in the end in greater discrepancy between the demands of the job and the available talent. It results in a dozen people being uprooted and pushed around in order to accomodate one,

Any job that has defeated two or three men in succession, even though each had performed well in previous assignments, must be assumed unfit for human beings. It must be redesigned.

The second rule for staffing from strength is to make each job demanding and big. Only if the job is demanding and big to begin with, will it enable a man to rise to the demands of a changed situation.

When hiring a person:
1. What has this person done well?
2. What is this person therefore likely to be able to do well?
3. What does this person hav to learn or to acquire to be able to get the full benefits of his strengths?
4. If I had a son or a daughter, would I be willing to let him or her work under this person?
	1. Yes, why?
	2. No, why?

Two mediocrities doesn't achieve as much as a good man.

The effective executive ask:
- What can my boss do well?
- What has he done really well?
- What does he need to use his strengths?

Few things can make an executive as effective as building on the strengths of his superior.

"Somebody else will not let me do anything", should always be suspected as cover-up for inertia.

If you start with the question: What can I do? You are almost certain to find that you can do much more than you have time and resources for.

### Questions
- What can I do to improve the effectiveness of my boss?

## Chapter 5 - First things first

If there is a secret to effectiveness, it is concentration. Effective executives do first things first and one thing at a time.

The secret to people who do "so many things" is that they do one thing at a time.

Ask:
- If we did not already do this, would we go into it now?

Yesterday successes tend to linger on for too long. They tend to be investments in managerial ego.

Always ask is still still worth doing? This is important for organizational "weight control".

Analysis of priorities:
- Pick the future against the past
- Focus on opportunity, rather than on problems
- Change your own direction, rather than climbing the bandwagon
- Aim high, aim for something that will make a difference, rather than for something that is safe and easy to do.

The effective executive does not, truly commit himself beyond the one task he concentrates on right now.

Concentration is the only hope of becoming the master of time and events.

### Questions:
- What something I do currently that I wouldn't go into now?

## Chapter 6 - The Elements of Decision-Making

Only executives makes decisions.

#### Elements of the effective decision process:

###### 1. Is this a generic situation or an exception?

Four different types of occurrences:
- The truly generic
- Unique for the individual institution, but its generic
- Truly exceptional, truly unique
- The new manifestation of a generic problem

The effective executives spends time figuring out which one of the categories his situation is in. But always first assume it is a generic problem. The effective executive solves generic situations through rule and policy.

###### 2. What are the objectives the decision have to reach? Conditions etc.

Clear thinking of boundary conditions is needed to identify the most dangerous of all possible decisions; the one that might just work if nothing ever goes wrong.

###### 3. Start out with what is right rather than what is acceptable

If one doesn't know what is right to satisfy the specifications and boundary conditions, one cannot distinguish between the right compromise and the wrong compromise.

###### 4. Converting the decision into action

Who has to know of the action?
What action has to be taken?

---

It's always important to build one's feedback around direct application to reality
### Questions:
- Do I assume problems are unique?

## Chapter 7 - Effective Decisions

A decision is a judgment, often it is more of a choice between two courses of actions.

To get the facts first is impossible. There are no facts unless one has a criterion of relevance. Events by themselves are not facts.

Effective executives insist on alternatives of measurement -- so they can choose the one appropriate.

###### There are three main reasons for the insistence on disagreement.
It is, first the only safeguard against the decision-maker becoming the prisoner of the organization. Everybody always wants something from the decision-maker.

Second, disagreement alone can provide alternatives to a situation.

Disagreement, especially if forced to be reasoned, thought through, documented, is the most effective stimulus we know.

The effective decision-maker, therefore, organizes disagreement. This protect him against being taken in by the plausible but false or incomplete.

The effective executive uses conflict of opinion as his tool to make sure all major aspects of an important matter are looked at carefully.

Also ask:
- Is a decision necessary?

Every decision is like a surgery. It is an intervention into a system and therefore carries with it the risk of shock. If we do not act, we will in all probability survive. But if we do act, we may be better off.

There is no inherent reason why medicines should taste horrible -- but effective ones usually do. Similarly, there is no inherent reason why decisions should be distasteful -- but effective ones are.

With the increased presence of computers more people all down the line in the organization will have to learn to be executives and to make effective decisions.
### Questions:
- What is one distasteful decision I am avoiding?

## Conclusion 

The book rests on two premises:
- The executives job is to be effective
- Effectiveness can be learned

1. Record where time goes, eliminate time wasters
2. Focus on contribution
3. Make strengths productive
4. First things first
5. Make effective decisions & rational actions

Organizations are not more effective because they have people. 

They have better people because they motivate self-development through their standards, habits and climate.
