## ch 1 - How Galileo Created the Problem of Consciousness

Descartes’s point is about knowledge: he knows for certain that he thinks—or more broadly that he is a conscious being—and in knowing this he thereby knows that he exists. The certain knowledge of one’s existence as a conscious being was, for Descartes, the starting point of all knowledge.

---

But if explaining consciousness is a work in progress, one might reasonably expect neuroscience to have yielded a partial explanation of consciousness, accounting for some human experiences but leaving trickier cases unexplained. The reality is that, for all its virtues, neuroscience has thus far failed to provide even the beginnings of an explanation.

--- 

Coming back to the problem of consciousness, it seems that it could go either way. Perhaps Seth is right that as we learn more about the brain we will eventually stop worrying where consciousness came from (although there is no sign of this happening yet). But it could equally be that the “Darwin of consciousness” will come along and solve the problem of consciousness in a satisfying way. In opposition to Seth, I will try to show not only that there is good reason for taking the problem of consciousness seriously, but also that there are already the makings of a theoretical framework that could bring about progress.

---


Similarly, the Churchlands claimed that our old-fashioned explanations of human behavior in terms of things like “thought,” “desire,” “hope,” “love” were becoming outdated. They looked forward to a day when we would drop such an antiquated vocabulary altogether and talk about human behavior in terms of its real causes: electrochemical processes in the brain.

---

But science can’t tell us that we don’t feel pain or see red. The reality of one’s feelings and experiences is immediately known in such a way that their existence cannot seriously be doubted.

---

There is a worry that the “Get out of the armchair and into the lab” approach can lead. to an oversimplistic conception of what science is, as though science were simply a matter of setting up experiments and then recording the data. Infact, certain crucial scientific developments have involved radically reimagining nature, dreaming up possibilities—perhaps from the comfort of an armchair—that nobody had previously entertained.

---

Of course, all of these novel reimaginings. of nature were subsequently tested with observation and experiment in order towork out whether we have any reason. to think that they are true. Nonetheless, the point remains that many important moments in scientific progress involved dreamingup new possibilities, conjuring up in the imagination new ways of thinking about the universe.

--- 

When we neglect the role of deep thought in science, we close off options. It is quite possible that. progress on our scientific understanding of consciousness will be made not only through observation of the brain—important as that is—but also through radically reimagining mind and brain, dreaming up new possibilities not so far entertained by our theories. In

---

While Descartes was the father of modern philosophy, Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) is standardly thought of as the father of modern science. His formulation of the mathematical laws of nature—the precursor of Newton’s (1643–1727) laws of motion and universal gravitation—and his defense of the Copernican view that the earth and planets revolve around the sun—for which he was persecuted by the Church—laid the foundations for the scientific revolution. What is perhaps less remarked upon is that Galileo was also one of the greatest philosophers who ever lived.

---

Why had previous thinkers not framed their theories of nature in mathematical language? The problem was that before Galileo philosophers took the world to be full of what philosophers call sensory qualities, things like colors, smells, tastes, and sounds. And it’s hard to see how sensory qualities could be captured in the purely quantitative language of mathematics. How could an equation ever explain to someone what it’s like to see red, or to taste paprika? How could an abstract mathematical description convey the sweet smell of flowers?

---
Galileo solved this problem with a radical reimagining of the material world. In this reimagining material objects don’t really have sensory qualities. Paprika isn’t really spicy, flowers don’t really smell of anything, objects aren’t really colored. In Galileo’s reimagined world, material objects have only the following characteristics:

- Size 
- Shape 
- Location
- Motion

Hence, for Galileo, the lemon I see in front of me isn’t really yellow, and it doesn’t really have a citrus smell and a sour taste. In reality the lemon is simply a thing which has a certain size, shape, and location. Of course, the lemon has parts, and there will be a great deal of complexity involved in the arrangement of and the relationship between these parts. But all of that complexity can, according to Galileo, be wholly characterized in terms of the sparse characteristics mentioned above: size, shape, location, and movement. What is so special about the characteristics of size, shape, location, and movement? The crucial point is that these characteristics can be captured in mathematics.

---

But what of the sensory qualities? If the yellowness, the citrus smell, and sour taste aren’t really in the lemon, then where are they? Galileo had an answer for this too: the soul.*2 For Galileo, the lemon itself isn’t really yellow; rather yellowness exists in the soul of the person perceiving the lemon. Likewise, neither the sour taste nor the citrus smell are really in the lemon; rather they’re in the soul of the person tasting or smelling the lemon. Just as beauty exists only in the eye of the beholder, so colors, smells, tastes, and sounds exist only in the conscious soul of a human being as she experiences the world. In other words, Galileo transformed the sensory qualities from features of things in the world—such as lemons—into forms of consciousness in the souls of human beings.

Consider the age-old philosophical conundrum, “If a tree falls in a forest, and there’s nobody there to hear it, does it make a sound?” In Galileo’s reimagining of the world, the answer is a clear and resounding no. The falling tree produces vibrations in the air, vibrations which have the mathematical characteristics of size, shape, location, and motion.

---

Physical science has indeed been extraordinarily successful, but we need to bear in mind that its success began when Galileo took the sensory qualities (sounds, smells, tastes, odors) out of its domain of inquiry: by reimagining them as forms of consciousness residing in the incorporeal soul. The fact that physical science has been extremely successful when it ignores the sensory qualities gives us no reason to think that it will be similarly successful if and when it turns its attention to the sensory qualities themselves, this time as forms of consciousness.

---

An “explanation” of consciousness that is unable to account for these sensory qualities would in fact be nothing of the sort. If Galileo traveled in time to the present day to hear that we are having difficulty giving a physical explanation of consciousness, he would most likely respond, “Of course you are, I designed physical science to deal with quantities not qualities!”

---

So long as we follow Galileo in thinking (A) that natural science is essentially quantitative and (B) that the qualitative cannot be explained in terms of the quantitative, then consciousness, as an essentially qualitative phenomenon, will be forever locked out of the arena of scientific understanding.

## Chapter 2 - Is There a Ghost in the Machine?

Historically, the most popular solution to the problem of consciousness is dualism. According to dualism, reality is made up of two very different kinds of thing: immaterial minds on the one hand and physical things on the other. Dualism defines minds and physical things in opposition to each other. Minds are nonphysical: they have no shape, size, or weight; they cannot be observed with any of the five senses. What characteristics do minds have? According to dualism, minds are the bearers of consciousness: it is the mind, not the brain, that thinks and feels. Physical entities, in contrast, have no mental characteristics. They have only the characteristics that we can observe or that we learn about in physical science: size, shape, mass, etc.*1

---

According to dualism, a human being is a kind of composite entity: a combination of a physical body and an immaterial mind.

---

As all philosophy undergraduates learn, the most famous dualist in Western philosophy was René Descartes.

---

Descartes inferred from this that the mind and body must be distinct things.

---

It is true that the dualist cannot explain the causal connection between the mind and brain, but this is arguably part of a more general limitation of human knowledge.

---

To make Hume’s point clear, consider Newton’s theory of gravity. Newton’s theory didn’t really explain gravity; rather it proposed a mathematical law that describes the gravitational attraction between all material entities. According to Newton’s law, all material entities attract each other with a force that is proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to the distance between them.

---

The point is: if it’s okay for the physicist to postulate basic and unexplained laws governing the causal interactions of matter, why isn’t it also okay for the dualist to postulate basic and unexplained laws governing the causal interactions of mind and brain?

---

However, Chalmers argued that most of the “explanations of consciousness” being proposed were nothing of the sort. These theories claimed to be explaining consciousness, but in reality they focused on some behavioral phenomenon closely associated with consciousness. They took, for example, the human ability to report verbally on internal states, labeled that “consciousness,” and then claimed that in explaining this behavioral capacity they had thereby explained consciousness. 

Chalmers categorized theories explaining the behavioral manifestations of consciousness as dealing with “the easy problems” of consciousness (although, as he concedes, even the easy problems are extremely hard!). The “hard problem” of consciousness, in contrast, was the challenge of explaining why the activity of the brain gives rise to experience: feelings, emotions, sensations, the subjective inner world each of us knows in her or his own case. As we discussed in the last chapter, neuroscience struggles to explain why subjective experience exists at all. With his simple three-word phrase, Chalmers swept away decades of evasion and forced us to confront the real mystery head-on.

---

What would be an example of a psycho-physical law? And how on earth can we know what the psycho-physical laws are? According to the naturalistic dualist, this is a scientific question and so we should look to science for the answer. In fact, the naturalistic dualist employs pretty much the same scientific method as the materialist. Contrary to common assumption, the data of neuroscience is neutral on the true explanation of consciousness and can be interpreted in either a dualist or a nondualist framework. Let us explore this point in some more detail.

---

To demonstrate the neutrality of neuroscience, consider the Integrated Information Theory—IIT for short—a leading contender in the contemporary neuroscientific study of consciousness. IIT is the brainchild of the neuroscientist Giulio Tononi, and is also vigorously defended by Christof Koch, who formerly collaborated on the topic of consciousness with the Nobel Laureate and co-discoverer of DNA Francis Crick. Tononi has formulated a mathematically precise way of defining the quantity of integrated information in a physical system. Very roughly, his proposal is that this measure of integrated information, which he labels “ϕ,” is also a measure of consciousness.

---

This leads to another way of understanding the distinction between the “easy problems” and the “hard problem” of consciousness: The Easy Problems: Which kinds of brain activity are correlated with consciousness? The Hard Problem: Why are certain kinds of brain activity correlated with consciousness?

---

If a naturalistic dualist were persuaded of the truth of IIT, then her view would be that there is a fundamental psycho-physical law of nature—as fundamental as the law of gravity—that wherever you have integrated information you have consciousness.

---

In other words, a nonphysical mind “intervening” in the brain is not much different in principle than a nonphysical God intervening in the body through healing. In both cases, something nonphysical—God or an immaterial mind—initiates a change in the physical world. In both cases, that change will have no physical explanation, and in that sense will be anomalous. Perhaps the only difference is that in the dualist case, the anomalous events would be much more frequent, due to the regular causal interactions between the mind and the brain. It would appear as though a poltergeist were playing with the brain.

---

How do naturalistic dualists respond to this worry? One speculative idea is that quantum mechanics might help us to locate the nexus between mind and body. In its essence, this idea has been discussed since the early days of quantum mechanics.

---

Quantum mechanics is basically a bit of mathematics which enables us to predict with great accuracy what’s going to happen in the physical world.

---

Why is quantum mechanics so hard to make sense of? There is not a single answer to this, rather there are a number of features of the theory that are hard to interpret. In chapter 4 we will discuss the phenomenon of “entanglement,” whereby a pair of particles behave as a unified system even though they are separated by such enormous distances that it is not possible for a causal signal to pass between them. Stranger still, in quantum mechanics particles need not have precise locations and velocities, but can instead exist in “superpositions” of various locations/velocities.

---

In its orthodox formulation of quantum mechanics, articulated by John von Neumann in 1932, there are two principles of nature governing at the subatomic level: the Schrödinger equation and the collapse postulate.7 However, these laws of nature are inconsistent: they cannot both govern the same physical system at the same time. ( check out neumann)

---

Why on earth would the fact that an observation is made change the world in this way? How does the universe know whether or not we’re looking? Many scientists and philosophers don’t like this at all and so try to find a way to avoid observation playing this crucial role in the theory. And this is where we start to get different interpretations of quantum mechanics.

---
As David Chalmers once remarked to me, “If you wanted a scientific theory that makes room for the conscious mind to play a fundamental role, you couldn’t hope for something better than quantum mechanics.” Quantum. dualism is a fascinating approach that deserves to be explored in more detail. A kind of cultural prejudice has prevented it from beingtaken more seriously and consequently it is not as well developed as other interpretations of quantum mechanics.

---

Returning to the question at hand, if dualism can’t account for mind-brain interaction, then it should be rejected for that reason. But even if it can, dualism is less simple and hence less attractive than other solutions to the problem of consciousness.


## Chapter 3 - Can Physical Science Explain Consciousness?

---
This kind of worry is entirely understandable. It is quite intuitive to think that in order to find out about the world, you have to go and look at it, by making observations or conducting experiments. If we had a magical sixth sense, then perhaps by entering into a deep meditative trance we could plumb the depths of reality from the comfort of an armchair. Sadly, we don’t.

---

How is it possible to draw such general conclusions about the universe without even standing up? By relying on the following most fundamental law of science in its most general sense: The Law of Noncontradiction—Any hypothesis which involves a contradiction is false.

---

There are two theories that dominate the philosophy of time: presentism and eternalism. Presentism is the theory of common sense. According to it, only the present moment exists: events in the past—such as the Norman conquest of England in 1066—have ceased to be, while events in the future—such as the first human landing on Mars—are yet to be. For the presentist, there is something very special about this second of this day, as events that happen at this time are the only ones that really exist. Eternalism maintains, in contrast, that all events in time are equally real. Imagine you were to look down at reality from a God’s eye point of view, with all events in time laid out in order, from the big bang to final “heat death” when all the energy of the universe has been used up. Eternalism tells us that from this perspective, there would be no special moment in time marked “now,” just as there is no special location marked “here.” Indeed, the word “now,” according to eternalism, functions like the word “here”: just as “here” is the name for where we are in space, so “now” is just the name for when we happen to be in time. And therefore, for a hypothetical creature outside of space and time, “now” and “here” would have no meaning.

---

So we need the eternalist theory of time to be true for time travel to be possible. The past and present need to actually be there in order for us to be able to visit them. That’s okay, as many physicists believe that eternalism, although arguably in tension with common sense, is strongly supported by Einstein’s theory of special relativity (Einstein’s theory fits better with eternalism because according to relativity there is no special, privileged “now”). And, indeed, within the context of eternalism, time travel is perfectly coherent. Again adopting our “God’s eye perspective” for the sake of illustration, we can imagine looking down at all the events in time laid out in order, and notice that one causal sequence—involving a DeLorean approaching 88 miles per hour—begins in the year 1985 and then continues in the year 1955.

---

Here are two things we know about consciousness: 
- Consciousness involves qualities: the redness of a red experience, the feel of an itch, the rich taste of biting into chocolate.
- Consciousness is subjective, in the sense that knowledge of a given state of consciousness involves adopting the perspective of someone who has that conscious state.

---
In his groundbreaking paper “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?,” Nagel argued that no matter how much we learn about the biology or neurophysiology of a bat, we will never understand its consciousness. This essential limitation arises from the fact that we cannot adopt the perspective of a creature that echolocates its way around its environment. There will always be something we cannot grasp about bats, namely, what it is like to be a bat.

---

After all, the reason we are unable to adopt a bat’s perspective is that human beings have a very different physical nature compared to bats. Perhaps in the future it will be possible for a blind person to have an operation that installs sophisticated sonar into her body, allowing her to echolocate her way around the world. Such a person might, through this alteration to her physical nature, be enabled to discover what it’s like to be a bat.

The Knowledge Argument 
1. If materialism is true, then Mary in her black-and-white room has a complete and final theory of. color experience.
2. If Mary in her black-and-white room has a complete and finaltheory of color experience, then it shouldn’t be possible for her to learn about some new essential features of color experiences.
3. And yet, when Mary leaves her room, she does come to learn about new essential features of color experiences: she learns about what it’s like to have color experiences. 
4. Therefore, Mary in her black-and-white room can’t have had a complete and final theory of color experiences and materialism is false. 
 
If neuroscience is unable to give us a complete theory of color experience, what does it leave out? It leaves out the subjective qualities involved in color experience, those qualities we are directly aware of when we see colors. When we have a yellow experience, we are directly aware of the yellowish quality that defines it. If a neuroscientific description of the brain could fully characterize this quality, then Mary in her black-and-white room could come to know what it’s like to have a yellow experience just by learning about the relevant neuroscience.

---
The Key Premise—Someone who has been blind from birth could not, through reading neuroscience (in braille), discover what it’s like to have a yellow experience.

---
In fact, physical sciences have been so successful precisely because from Galileo onward they set aside the qualitative in order to focus on the quantitative. The fact that physical science has done well when it ignores consciousness gives us no reason to think it will do well when it tries to apply its quantitative methods to consciousness itself.

---
How can you possibly know whether or not Susan is a zombie? By the very definition of a zombie, Susan would behave exactly the same if she was one. This is the philosophical challenge known as the problem of other minds. One purpose of thinking about zombies is that it helps make the problem of other minds vivid.

---

In a way, the zombie argument is a long-winded way of demonstrating something that’s pretty obvious. To describe a person in terms of his or her physical nature is to. ascribe to that person certain objective, quantitative properties. To describe someone in terms of his or her conscious experiences is to ascribe to that person certain subjective, qualitative properties. And the fact that a physical systemhas the former kind of properties does not entail that it has the latter kind of properties. This is the core of the problem of consciousness. Contemporary materialism is not a solution but a stubborn refusal to face up to the problem.

---
And after all, the only evidence we have for the existence of consciousness is that it seems to people that they are conscious. If we can explain away that seeming as. an illusion, and thus avoid a radical expansion of our current scientific paradigm, then surely that should be the preferred option. This is a beautiful, elegant solution to the problem of consciousness that easily avoids all of the difficulties raised thus far in this chapter. If consciousness does notexist, then we don’t need a scientific theory of it, any more than we need a scientific theory of astrology or alchemy. This is not to say the view is problem-free. The central challenge for illusionism—as Frankish has dubbed his position—is to explain how the brain manages to pull off this remarkable magic trick, how it manages to convince us to believe with such certainty that subjective qualities really exist. But solving this form of the “problem of consciousness” does not require a radical revision to our current scientific paradigm.

---
Philosophers are torn on this issue. The American philosopher John Searle designed a thought experiment intended to show that mere computation, even computation powerful enough to pass the Turing Test, is not sufficient for genuine understanding. This is the famous “Chinese Room” thought experiment.18 Searle imagines a room containing a human being who doesn’t speak Chinese, but who has a huge number of pieces of paper containing Chinese symbols and a book containing instructions telling her which Chinese symbol is correct to “output” given a certain Chinese symbol as “input.” Outside the room there are native Chinese speakers, who pass questions in Chinese under the door. The non–Chinese speaker inside the room receives these “inputs,” looks them up in the book of instructions, and then delivers the correct “outputs.” If the book of instructions is detailed and wide-ranging enough, then the room will simulate the responses of a native Chinese speaker. And yet the person inside the room does not speak Chinese but is rather just blindly following instructions. And it is intuitively obvious, according to Searle, that the room itself does not understand Chinese. What we have is merely the appearance of understanding in the absence of genuine comprehension. What Searle has done is provide a vivid way of reflecting on what a computer is. In line with how Turing defined “computation,” a computer is something that follows instructions. The Chinese Room is effectively a kind of computer following a program, the program being the set of instructions contained in the book. If the program is good enough, the room’s responses would be indistinguishable from those of a native Chinese speaker and hence will pass the Turing Test. And yet, once we see that all that is really going on is blind following of instructions, it is just obvious—according to Searle—that this is not sufficient for genuine understanding.

---
Let us further suppose that the computers of the future will not be conscious. (Indeed, as we shall see in the next chapter, according to the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness, the processing of computers is not integrated enough to give rise to consciousness.) In this case, the computers in question will be able think and understand despite having no conscious experience at all.

---

However, in academic philosophy, the dominant view amongst materialists is that consciousness does not need to be explained. According to what we might call the “brute identity theory,” conscious states are identical to brain states and that’s all that needs to be said. We don’t need to give some “explanation” of how, say, the feeling of pain can be accounted for in terms of a certain kind of brain state. If we have sufficient empirical evidence that pain is identical with brain state X, which brute identity theorists claim we would have if pain were found to be systematically correlated with brain state X, then we can simply assert the identity and the case is closed. It is a philosophical confusion, according to the brute identity theory, to suppose that anything more is required.*

## Chapter 4 - How to Solve the Problem of Consciousness

Panpsychism is the view that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of physical reality. This view is much misunderstood. Drawing on the literal meaning of the term—“pan” = everything, “psyche” = mind—it is commonly supposed that panpsychists believe that all kinds of inanimate objects have rich conscious lives: that your socks, for example, may currently be going through a troubling period of existential angst. 

This way of understanding panpsychism is wrong on two counts. Firstly, panpsychists tend not to think that literally everything is conscious. They believe that the fundamental constituents of the physical world are conscious, but they need not believe that every random arrangement of conscious particles results in something that is conscious in its own right. Most panpsychists will deny that your socks are conscious, while asserting that they are ultimately composed of things that are conscious.

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, panpsychists do not believe that consciousness like ours is everywhere. The complex thoughts and emotions enjoyed by human beings are the result of millions of years of evolution by natural selection, and it is clear that nothing of this kind is had by individual particles. If electrons have experience, then it is of some unimaginably simple form.

---

In fact, there is some empirical support for panpsychism, which we’ll get to later. But the main attraction of panpsychism is not its ability to account for the data of observation, but its ability to account for the reality of consciousness. We know that consciousness is real and so we have to account for it somehow. If a general theory of reality has no place for consciousness, then that theory cannot be true. What panpsychism offers us is a way of integrating consciousness into our scientific picture of the world, a way that avoids the deep problems associated with dualism on the one hand and materialism on the other.

---

To be sure, panpsychism does not offer a reductive explanation of consciousness, that is to say, it does not explain consciousness in terms of something more fundamental than consciousness. However, it is a prejudice of materialism to suppose that this is obligatory.

---

The roots of this revolution were the rediscovery, by Strawson and others, of crucial work on consciousness from the 1920s by the philosopher Bertrand Russell and the scientist Arthur Eddington. I am convinced that Russell and Eddington did for the science of consciousness what Darwin did for the science of life. It is to this topic we now turn.

---

Russell had discovered a radical new approach that managed to circumnavigate the perennial debate between materialists and dualists. In the very same year that Russell published his view, Eddington used his Gifford lectures to expound his own take on it. These two men certainly fit Eddington’s image of the scientist and the philosopher tunneling toward each other: as well as dealing with the problem of consciousness, Russell’s 1927 book The Analysis of Matter offered philosophical reflections on the new scientific theories of relativity and quantum mechanics.

---
If physics is not telling us the nature of physical reality, what is it telling us? The crucial point Eddington is trying to convey with his talk of “pointer readings” is that physics is a tool for prediction. Even if we don’t know what “mass” and “force” really are, we are able to recognize them in the world. They show up as readings on our instruments, or otherwise impact on our senses. And by using the equations of physics, such as Newton’s law of gravity, we can predict what’s going to happen with great precision (although strictly speaking Newton’s law has been displaced by general relativity, it’s still generally used as it’s accurate enough for most purposes). It is this predictive capacity that has enabled us to manipulate the natural world in extraordinary ways, leading to the technological revolution that has transformed our planet.

---
And yet intuitively there must be more to what an electron is than what it does. An electron must have an intrinsic nature, as philosophers like to say.

---
This takes a while to absorb. We are used to thinking that physical science is telling us about the “stuff” of the world. When we learn that water is H2O, or that heat is molecular motion, we are inclined to think that we are discovering the real nature of water and heat. This is partly because chemistry characterizes these phenomena by identifying their atomic components, and so we feel we are learning something when we come to know that water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen. It is only when we get down to the physical explanation of what “hydrogen” or “oxygen” are that we discover (i) that chemistry characterizes hydrogen and oxygen entirely in terms of their physical components, but also (ii) that physics tells us absolutely nothing about the intrinsic nature of those components.

---

In other words, I have but one small window onto the intrinsic nature of matter: I know that the intrinsic nature of the matter inside my brain involves consciousness. I know this because I am directly aware of the reality of my own consciousness. And, assuming dualism is false, this reality I am directly aware of is at least part of the intrinsic nature of my brain.*2

---
This points the way to an elegant solution to the problem of consciousness. In essence, the problem of consciousness can be put as follows: The Problem of Consciousness—How do we integrate consciousness into our scientific story of the universe? — In this chapter we have encountered another problem, one that on the face of it has nothing to do with consciousness: The Problem of Intrinsic Natures—Physics tells us nothing of the intrinsic nature of matter. The brilliant insight of Eddington, building on Russell, was to solve both of these problems at once: 

Problem 1: We need a place for consciousness.
Problem 2: We have a huge hole at the center of our scientific story. 

Solution: Plug the hole with consciousness. In other words, Eddington’s proposal is that consciousness is the intrinsic nature of matter. It is consciousness, for Eddington, that breathes fire into the equations of physics.

---

This seems a coherent proposal. But what reason do we have to take it seriously? The first thing to say is that it’s not clear that there’s an alternative. This is because, strange as it might sound at first hearing, there doesn’t seem to be a candidate for being the intrinsic nature of matter other than consciousness. Certainly, physical science does not furnish us with an alternative option, given its silence on the intrinsic nature of matter (see Technical Appendix B for more detail). And if neither introspection nor observation gives us a clue as to the intrinsic nature of matter, where else are we supposed to look?

---
Furthermore, there is a strong case that panpsychism is the simplest theory consistent with what we directly know about the nature of matter. Eddington’s starting point is as follows: Physical science tells us absolutely nothing about the intrinsic nature of matter, and The only thing we know about the intrinsic nature of matter is that some of it, i.e., the matter inside brains, has an intrinsic nature made up of forms of consciousness.

---
Eddington’s panpsychism was not dualistic. His view was not that particles have two sets of properties: physical properties (mass, charge, spin, etc.) on the one hand and nonphysical consciousness properties on the other. The view is rather that the physical properties of a particle (mass, spin, charge, etc.) are themselves forms of consciousness. Those very properties that physical science characterizes behavioristically are, in their intrinsic nature, forms of consciousness.

---

More generally, Eddingtonian panpsychism gives us an elegant way to unify mind and matter, and thus to avoid altogether the irresolvable dispute between dualism and materialism. The dualist offers us a radically disunified picture of reality, with no obvious way of explaining how mind and brain interact. Materialism brings unity, but at the cost of having no place for consciousness. Eddington’s panpsychism avoids all of these problems. It has all the simplicity and unity of materialism, but it also has a place for consciousness.

---

In chapter 2 we discussed the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness—or IIT for short—a leading neuroscientific theory of consciousness according to which consciousness is associated with the integrated information in a physical system. What I did not mention there was that IIT has panpsychist implications, implications which its creator, Giulio Tononi, freely accepts. Almost any physical system is associated with some degree of integrated information, even a single molecule. The presence of integrated information does not in itself indicate the presence of consciousness, according to IIT. The theory tells us that, in any physical system, consciousness is present at the level at which there is the most integrated information.

---

While both the materialist and the panpsychist have a gap to close, the panpsychist—in contrast to the materialist—is trying to bridge a gap between two things of essentially the same kind: The Materialist Gap—Between the objective quantities of physical science and the subjective qualities of consciousness. The Panpsychist Gap—Between the simple subjective qualities postulated to exist at the micro-level and the complex subjective qualities we know to exist in human and animal brains.

---

What on earth is going on here? On the face of it, we seem to have two conscious minds located within the one brain. The “mind” located in the left hemisphere is in charge of speech but is unable to recognize faces; the “mind” located in the right hemisphere has facial recognition but is effectively mute. The panpsychist philosopher Luke Roelofs, currently a research fellow at Bochum University in Germany, believes that the split-brain cases may provide crucial insights into the secrets of mental combination.

---

Moreover, Roelofs sees in the split-brain cases a way of reimagining the combination problem. Rather than conceiving of the split-brain patient as two minds in one cranium, Roelofs thinks of the patient as a single individual with disunified consciousness. Right now, you are enjoying unified conscious experience: your visual experience of these words, your auditory experience of the sounds around you, the tactile experience of the chair beneath you, are all enfolded in a single unified experience. In contrast, although the split-brain patient has both the visual experience available to the left hemisphere (e.g., the image of the piano) and the visual experience available to the right hemisphere (e.g., the image of the bell), she does not enjoy a single unified experience involving each of these experiences (piano + bell). The consciousness of the split-brain patient is fragmented.

---

To solve the combination problem, we just need to work out what is going on in the living brain to unify together the otherwise isolated experiences of particles.

---

It is just this kind of reimagining of a problem that theoretical progress is built on. An intractable problem—How does particle consciousness become brain consciousness?—turns into a tractable one—How does a disunified brain become a unified brain? 

---

Almost everything contains some integrated information. But IIT does not hold that literally everything has consciousness. It does not predict, for example, that a random collection of pebbles on a beach has its own conscious awareness. According to IIT, a system is conscious when it is a maximum of integrated information, a notion we can define as follows: System S is a maximum of integrated information when the following two principles are satisfied: Not surpassed from below: No proper part of S has more integrated information than S. Not surpassed from above: S is not a proper part of something with more integrated information than S.

Why would we need another word for physics? But as we have discovered in earlier chapters, physics is simply not in the business of doing ontology.
