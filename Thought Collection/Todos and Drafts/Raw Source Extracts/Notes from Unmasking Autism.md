Together, all of this means that Autistic people tend to have the following qualities:

- We are hyperreactive to even small stimuli in our environment
- We have trouble distinguishing between information or sensory data that should be ignored versus data that should be carefully considered
- We are highly focused on details rather than “big picture” concepts
- We’re deeply and deliberatively analytical
- Our decision-making process is methodical rather than efficient; we don’t rely on mental shortcuts or “gut feelings”
- Processing a situation takes us more time and energy than it does for a neurotypical person”

**p.15-16**
Autism is associated with a deliberative processing style. 

When making sense of the world, Autistic people usually defer to logic and reason rather than emotion or intuition. We dive deep into all the pros and cons, sometimes excessively so, not knowing where to draw the line between an important variable and an unimportant one. We tend not to get habituated to familiar situations or stimuli as readily as other people, so we often think through a situation as if it’s completely new to us, even if it isn’t. All of this requires a lot of energy, focus, and time, so we get exhausted and overloaded quite easily. However, it also makes us less prone to errors. 

**p. 16**
Autistic people process the world from the bottom up.

Autistic people, on the flip side, don’t rely on knee-jerk assumptions or quick mental shortcuts to make our decisions. We process each element of our environment separately, and intentionally, taking very little for granted. If we’ve never been in a particular restaurant before, we may be slow to make sense of its layout or figure out how ordering works. 

**p. 17**
Autism is behavioral.

Autism is associated with repetitive self-stimulatory behavior (“stimming”),which can be something as benign as hand-flapping, or as severe as chewing one’s fingers until they bleed. Stimming is an important means of self-regulation. It helps soothe us when we’re anxious or overloaded with stress, and it helps us express joy and enthusiasm.

**p. 18**
Some Autistic people can’t speak; others are incredibly hyperverbal from a young age, with huge vocabularies. Some Autistics can read people’s emotions so easily that it’s overwhelming; others empathize with animals or objects, but not people; some of us have zero emotional empathy. But all of us are full-formed humans with a capacity to care for others and behave ethically. Some Autistic people have no “special interests”; others are fanatical about dozens of subjects. Some of us have skills we are adept at; others need help in every facet of our existence. What unites us, generally speaking, is a bottom-up processing style that impacts every aspect of our lives and how we move through the world, and the myriad practical and social challenges that come with being different.

**p. 21**
An Autistic shutdown happens when an Autistic person gets so overstimulated and stressed, they can no longer process their surroundings. It’s the quieter, more interior counterpart to an Autistic meltdown, which tends to involve more crying, self-harm, or outward aggression. Shutdowns are essentially a way of dissociating from one’s surroundings. It can look like falling asleep very suddenly, becoming unresponsive, or just kind of zoning out (which is how it presented in Crystal’s case). 

**p. 42**
Autism can also look a lot like an anxiety disorder. Most of us are anxious nearly every moment we’re around other people, after all. Overstimulating, unpredictable surroundings will tend to activate our fight-or-flight response. The rituals and repetitive behaviors we develop to cope with stress can look a lot like Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Autistic burnout presents very much like a major depressive episode. All too often, these negative mental health consequences of masking are what a therapist recognizes, rather than the untreated disability that’s caused it.

**p. 53**
Masked Autistics tend to arrange our lives around our limitations and needs, and sacrifice anything that might demand too much energy out of us. An impressive resume or academic transcript might hide the fact our homes are messy, our hair is unbrushed, and we haven’t socialized with anybody recreationally in months. In a few key areas we may appear to be functioning highly, but that façade requires we let everything else in life fall apart.

Fawning and People-Pleasing Reflection Tool

Consider each statement and reflect on how true each one is for you.
- It doesn’t feel like anyone knows the “real” me.
- I don’t know how to say no to people.
- I feel responsible for managing other people’s feelings and reactions, even when they don’t involve me.
- I sometimes feel like I’m betraying myself by going along with things I don’t agree with.
- I closely monitor social situations to see when conflict is brewing, and try to stop it before it starts.”

1. ”Let’s start at the beginning: the first step of the unmasking process is realizing you’re Autistic. ”
2. ”The process of unmasking is all about rethinking the beliefs and behaviors that seemed normal prior to discovering we were Autistic.”
3. ”Finally, unmasking demands that we look back on our past selves with a spirit of grace, gradually learning to see that the sides of ourselves that we were told were too loud, too stilted, too weird, or too much are actually completely fine, even wonderful, and absolutely deserving of love.”

”Divergent Design Questions
- What are some textures that ground you or your senses?
- Do you enjoy a minimalistic, spare space, or a cozy space filled with familiar objects?
- What smells do you find relaxing? What smells invigorate you?
- Do you enjoy dim light, colorful lights, or bright, white lights?
- What objects do you enjoy holding or having near you?					
- Do you need background noise in order to focus? Is there ambient noise in your surroundings that you need to block out?
- Do you hold on to any objects or furniture out of a sense that you “should” appreciate them? If you could let go of those things, what might you want to put in their place?”

**p. 93-94** 

Engaging our special interests is an important part of maintaining Autistic people’s mental health; one study by clinical psychologist Melis Aday found that Autistic adults’ participation in special interests was associated with stress management, and with having low levels of depression. One interpretation of this data is that when an Autistic person has the energy to enjoy their special interests, doing so is a valuable anxiety-reduction technique. It’s equally important that we make time for repetitive, self-stimulatory behavior as well, as research has repeatedly shown that improves our mental health and coping. Neurotypical standards don’t account for Autistic people’s need for time to recharge, fidget, and hyperfocus on our favorite activities. This may mean we don’t have the energy or time to keep up with other tasks at an abled person’s pace.

**p. 94** 
On a practical level, how can an Autistic person learn to embrace spiral time? Marta Rose says it comes down to two points:

- Expand the time frame you use to gauge productivity and success. Take the “long view” of your life. Don’t be afraid to cycle back to old projects, or let a passion go when it’s not serving you.
- Slow down. Stillness helps neurodivergent minds process the huge quantities of data we take in.”

**p. 95**

”Many neurodiverse people suffer from Autistic inertia. The same heightened focus that makes us so good at studying our special interests for hours also makes it challenging for us to get off the couch and attend to the overflowing trash. To an external, neurotypical observer, it doesn’t look like we’re struggling. It just looks like we’re being “lazy.” Almost every neurodiverse person I’ve spoken to has been deemed “lazy” numerous times by exasperated parents, teachers, and friends. People see us sitting frozen, incapable of taking action, and assume it’s because we don’t care or lack willpower.”

**p. 97**

”Radical visibility, in other words, is absolutely antithetical to masking. Where masking conceals, radical visibility steps into the limelight. Where masking scans the environment constantly for signs of social threat, and reins in the unruly stims and tics of the Autistic body, radical visibility encourages it to simply be.”

- Why do I want to come out? What do I hope will happen?
- What do I wish people understood better about me?
- How much energy am I willing to put into educating this person about what Autism “really” is?
- Do I have a specific “ask” that I’d like to make, such as a request for an accommodation or different treatment?

”It’s vitally important that in addition to all the individual-level work we put into unmasking and demanding our needs get met, that we also find and cultivate supportive relationships with people who make it a lot easier to do so. That’s what the next exercise is all about—breaking down any tendency to people-please, and developing deeper relationships with what Samuel Dylan Finch calls your “strawberry people.”

”I made a Google doc of people who were ‘too nice’ to me,” he writes. “In my phone contacts, I put emojis by their names. I put strawberries next to people who were super loving. I put seedling emojis by folks who taught me things that made me think or grow.”

”Instead of having to make manual decisions about whom to respond to and in which order, the “strawberry people” system reinforces the idea that certain relationships are more important than others, because they help you cultivate a more solid sense of self.”

**p. 107**

”People with an anxious-ambivalent attachment are difficult to soothe and reassure, and don’t see close loved ones as a safe, “secure base” they can find comfort in when lost or threatened. As adults, people who are anxious-ambivalent tend to get into patterns of intense emotional dependency, combined with insecurity. They yearn to be accepted yet doubt that they can be. When other people try to connect with us, we rebuff them without even realizing it.”

**p. 108**

”Are You Pushing Your “Strawberry People” Away?
- When someone gives you a compliment, do you feel like you have to downplay it?
- Are there people in your life who seem “too nice”? Who are they?
- Are you afraid of trusting people because they might abandon you?
- When someone gives you positive attention, do you feel creeped out?
- Are you afraid that kind, loving people deserve “better” than to be friends with you?
- When someone gets vulnerable with you, do you find ways to downplay it?
- Do you have a hard time showing people that you like them?”

- ”Who do I feel comfortable expressing disagreement to?
- Who helps me think about my opinions and choices in a nonjudgmental way?
- Who tells me honestly when I’ve hurt them, and gives me a real opportunity to do better?
- Who treats me with respect no matter what?
- Who leaves me feeling rejuvenated or inspired?
- Who brings out the wild, playful side of me?
- Is there anyone I want to try being more open and unfiltered with?”

**p. 109** 

”On the flip side, I’ve found that I can identify who is not destined to become a “strawberry person” for me by pondering these questions:

- Who do I force myself to spend time with, out of a sense of obligation or guilt?
- Who do I feel I have to earn the approval of?
- Who makes me feel insecure and not good enough?
- Who do I find exhausting to be around?
- Who do I edit or censor myself around?”

”I used to shy away from nerdy communities, or from socializing with anybody who couldn’t hide their awkwardness as well as I could. I was trying my damnedest to seem as normal and neurotypical as possible and feared that if I even stood near someone who violated society’s rules, I’d be outed as the freak I secretly was.”
