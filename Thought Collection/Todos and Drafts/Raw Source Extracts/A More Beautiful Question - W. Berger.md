## Notes Foreword  "Why Questioning" 

### Idea: Questions are Catalysts for Innovation
When the author was searching for a denominator amongst brilliant change-makers, he recognized many of them were excellent at asking questions. 

If we know (or at least strongly suspect) that questioning is a starting point for innovation, then why doesn't businesses embrace it? 

Some possible answers is that it challenges authority and disrupts structures, processes, and systems.

### A Beautiful Question
A beautiful question is an ambitious yet actionable question that can begin to shift the way we perceive or think about something which can be the starting point for change.

The author has a model for forming and tackling "big beautiful questions" called "Why-What If-How".

### Questions:
#### Why Questioning?
- Are there more reasons groups and collectives such as companies discourage questions?
- Do I have have any beautiful questions in my life right now?

## Notes Chapter 1 "The Power of Inquiry" 

### Experts are Poor Questioners
Questioning often has an inverse relationship to expertise -- such that, within their subject areas, experts are apt to be poor questioners. 

If you "know" there is no reason to ask; yet if you don't ask, then you are relying on expert knowledge that is certainly limited, may be outdated and could be altogether wrong.

### Questions can Lead to Discoveries
S. Firestein argues that one of the keys to scientific discovery is the willingness of the scientists to embrace ignorance and use questions as a means to navigate towards new discoveries.

Questions can lead to many answers, searches for solutions, and can generate new fields of inquiry etc. Answers on the other hand, often ends the process.

### Questions as a Brainstorming Tool
Heilman notes, since divergent thinking is about "Hey what if I think differently about this?" it is actually a form of asking questions.

What we know about divergent thinking is that it mostly happens in the more creative right hemisphere of the brain; that it taps into imagination and often trigger random associations of ideas (which is the primary source for creativity)

### Tone is Important When Asking Questions
"Oh my god, what are we going to do?" vs. "What if this represents an opportunity for us? How might we make most out of this situation?"

### Innovation and Questions
In some sense, innovation means trying to find and formulate new questions that can over time, be answered. Those questions, once identified, often become the basis for starting a new venture.

If you are able to find a problem before others do, and then successfully answer the questions surrounding that problem, you can create a new venture, new career, or a new industry.
### Questions vs. Answers Stock in a Complex World
![[Pasted image 20250720121141.png|400]]

The sentiment from the book is that facts are less important when technology more and more has it covered.

### Neoteny
Neoteny means "retention of childlike attributes in adulthood", we should strive to be somewhat neotenous when it comes to learning and exploring. We should use questions just like a child to make sense of the world.

### Embrace Change
If you are comfortable questioning, experimenting, connecting things, changes become like an adventure.

### Sitting with Questions
Often the worst thing you can do with a difficult question is to try to answer it too quickly. When the mind is coming up with "What If" possibilities these new ideas can take time to form.

What sets apart the innovative questioners is their ability, mostly born out of persistence and determination to give form to their ideas and make them real. When done asking the "Why" and "What Ifs", they shift into "How can I".

Effective questioners let each answer they stumble upon bring with it a new wave of questions.
### Questions:
#### Chapter 1 "The Power of Inquiry" 
- Are there areas where I have stopped questioning things? 
- How can I use a brainstorm session with questions at work?
- How can I be more mindful of tone of questions?
- How can I take ownership of questions?
### Bonus:
- How is my field/industry changing?
- What trends are having the most impact on my field, and how is that likely to play out over the next few years?
- Which of my existing skills are most useful and adaptable in this new environment—and what new ones do I need to add?
- Should I diversify more—or focus on specializing in one area?
- Should I be thinking more in terms of finding a job—or creating one?


## Notes Chapter 2 "Why We Stop Questioning" 

### What's Known Gets Forgotten, What's New Gets Noticed
Children constantly encounter things they cannot classify or label, they have not yet developed "mental models" to categorize things.

So in a way they ask adults to help them do this by asking questions.

Once things things have been "labeled" and sorted, they become known, and we do not think or even notice them.

### Schools are Like Factories
To the extent that a school is like a factory, students who inquire about "the way things are", could be seen as insubordinate. If schools were built on a factory model, were they actually designed to squelch questions.

What if our schools could train students to be lifelong learners and better adapt to change, by enabling them to become better questioners.

How might we create such a school?

### Questioning Involves Sophisticated Thinking
Rothenstein maintains that questioning is a more subtle and complex skill than many realize, involving three kinds of sophisticated thinking, divergent, convergent, and metacognitive.

### The Socratic Method
The Socratic method can be very useful in teaching and learning:
 - Don't give direct answers
 - Offer questions
 - Help students realize there is never one "correct" answer, unless all other have been ruled out.

### Questions:
#### Chapter 2 "Why We Stop Questioning" 
- In what way is questioning a divergent, convergent and metacognitive activity?

### Bonus:
Rothstein and Santana then designed a program for K–12 classrooms, broken down into a series of steps: 
- **Teachers design a Question Focus** (e.g., “Torture can be justified”). 
- **Students produce questions** (no help from the teacher; no answering or debating the questions; write down every question; change any statements into questions).
- **Students improve their questions** (opening and closing them).
- **Students prioritize their questions**. They are typically instructed to come to agreement on three favorites. 
- **Students and teachers decide on next steps**, for acting on the prioritized questions.
- **Students reflect** on what they have learned.


## Notes Chapter 3 "The Why, What If, and How of Innovative Questioning"

### What If, How, Why
What If is about imagining
How is about doing
Why is about seeing and understanding
	...and requires stepping back from both doing and knowing

### The Feeling of Knowing
The feeling of knowing is only a feeling or a sensation. The feeling is so strong that people walk around convinced they have more answers than they actually do.

---
Part of asking naive questions, is to have people explain things simply.

In some cultures people welcome outsiders coming in and asking basic questions because they may be wondering about these things themselves, but they don't want to ask themselves.

### Advantages of the Beginner Mind
"In the beginners mind there are many possibilities, but in the experts there are few". The mind of the beginner is free from the habits of the expert.

### Vuja De
"Vuja De", looking at something familiar and suddenly see it fresh.

Great questioners "keep looking" -- at a situation or a problem,  at the ways people around them behave, at their own behaviors. They study the small details; and thus look for not only what's there but what's missing.

### Questioning the Question
Sometimes it's useful to question our questions.

- Why did I come up with that question?
- What are the underlying assumptions?
- Is there a different question I should be asking?

You can use the Five WHY's technique with this or use opening and closing of questions.

Why is my father-in-law so hard to get along with? (open) vs. Is my father-in-law hard to get along with? (closed)

### Asking Questions Closer to the Context
Contextual inquiry is about asking questions up close and in the context. There we can observe, listen, and use empathy to guide us toward more intelligent, and therefore more effective questions.

### What If and Combinatoral Thinking
What if questions often involves the ability to combine ideas and influences. Combinatoral thinking is basically this idea.

Not all combinations are equal, in terms of yielding creative insights.

The more obvious combinations happen in the left hemisphere of the brain, the big insights that can solve problems or come up with highly creative new ideas, often involve these remote connections that can happen in the right hemisphere.

### Spend Time with Questions
For a questioner it's important to spend time with a challenging question instead of answering it right away. 

---

A prototype is a question, embodied, and given a body the question becomes harder to ignore.

---

In our new world there is demand for us to be not only better questioners, but also experimenters.

### Learning from Failure

W. Churchill once said "The trick is to go from one failure to another, with no loss of enthusiasm"

How to learn from failure? By questioning:
- Why did it fail?
- What can I take with me?

### Questions:
#### Chapter 3 "The Why, What If, and How of Innovative Questioning"
- Is there a new hobby I can get to explore with the beginners mindset?
- How can I integrate refinement of questions?

## Notes Chapter 4 "Questioning in Business" 

### Disruptive Innovation 
"Disruptive Innovation", innovation from perhaps smaller companies disrupting the status quo and market leaders. Often because the new thing is simpler, more convenient, and more affordable.

If you can make something expensive and complex and make it affordable and accessible, you open up a mass market and change the game.

### Company Mission
Most businesses would acknowledge that it is in business to make money so that it can stay in business. However, most good companies are born trying to answer a question and solve a problem. 

Sometimes companies have to ask again what they do and who they serve. 

For any organization it is galvanizing to have a strong purpose and values, no matter what they might be.

The company mission can be articulated as a question, this tells the world we are not "there" yet, but on a journey.
### What Companies Shouldn't Do
J. Bergstrand thinks one of the most important question companies should ask regularly is what we should stop doing? We tend to focus on what we should start doing.

### A Better Experiment
A good question is how can we make a better experiment. 

It's somewhat counter-intuitive for most managers - who tend to think in terms of "making products", not "making experiments".

Sometimes it's good to instead of asking: "What will we do or build?", to ask "What will we learn?"

### Questionstorming
Questionstorming can be a way to think more freely and creatively. Some of the peer pressure in this format is lower than in conventional brainstorming. Answers tend to be judged harsher than questions.

### How Might We?
"How might we"  is a good way to ask, don't do "can" or "should"

### Leaders in Business Should Ask Questions
Business leaders should be the chief question asker for their organization. When leading a team, a start-up or a public company, your primary occupation must be to discover the future. Questions are a good way for navigating uncharted terrain.

### Outsider Perspectives
Outsiders should help in providing new perspectives, rather than answers unless hired for a specific task. Often the specialists in the business reside in the company.

### A Culture of Inquiry
"How can we create a culture of inquiry?" is an important question, but the question is also "do we want a culture of inquiry?". 

Employees with leeway to question, would mean policies can be challenged. Maybe leaders or managers don't want to have to explain and rationalize or feel their authority threatened. Also, those with expertise may resent having their learned views questioned by non-experts.

If you do still want a culture of inquiry leaders have to walk the talk, you also have to look for ways get punished or rewarded. Like punishing someone to fix the problem they identified themselves.

One of the best ways to grow a culture of inquiry is to hire people who are naturally inquisitive. look for the questions applicants ask.
### Transforming the Workplace into a Learning Place
Curiosity and learning go hand in hand, so a big question is how do we transform a workplace into a learn place? Google created Google University as an example.

The best corporate learning environments have some common elements. 
- Bringing in outsiders to teach and inspire
- Encouraging insiders to teach each others
- Putting employees work on the walls to share ideas

### Questions:
#### Chapter 4 "Questioning in Business" 
- How can I learn more at work?
- Can I help build a culture of inquiry?

## Notes Chapter 5 "Questioning for Life" 

### The Need For a Good Compass
In a rapidly changing world there isn't a step-by-step map, the best you can hope to have is a good compass to guide you.

Questions:
- Why am I climbing this mountain?
- What is waiting for me at the top?
- What am I going to do once I get there?
- Am I enjoying the climb itself? Should I slow down or speed up?
- What am I leaving behind down below?

### Evading Inquiry?
Why are you evading inquiry?
- Questioning is seen as counter-productive (we want answers)
- It's not the right time
- Knowing what to ask is difficult
- What if we don't have good answers to our questions

### The Quest for Answers
You don't just "find" answers to complex life problems, you work your way there.

We have to construct meaning, not find it.

There is nothing wrong with not having answers to questions, it's the nature of complex tasks at times. We need to be comfortable with uncertainty.

The more you are questioning the easier it gets. We should make it a habit and process, otherwise we won't find time.

### Appreciative Inquiry
When questioning your own life it's also important to look via "appreciative inquiry" for what's there. It lets us focus on strengths and assets. Community and connectedness is a common thread among the happiest people.

### Where do You Shine?
Think about and question what time, place, and activity in your life where you shine the most and feel most alive. Identify and appreciate it.

- Why do shine when I do X?
- Can I incorporate this in my life more?

### Act into a New Way of Thinking
It's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than to think your way into a new way of acting. Do something differently over time and you will eventually change your mind.

### Career Change
A key first step to aa successful career change is crafting experiments. Most real-life career transitions take 3 years. We learn who we are -- in practice not in theory -- by testing the reality.

### Questioning Failing
What would you attempt if you knew you couldn't fail? 

But you could also consider:
- What if I fail -- how will I recover?

The thought of it is often more scary than the failing itself.

What's truly worth doing, whether you fail or succeed?

### Find Common Ground in Questions
Sometimes it's easier to agree in statements of differing opinions not on answers but on questions. This can be a way to find common ground.

### Crafting Your Life's Beautiful Question
Look for a question that is "ambitious yet actionable". Hard enough to be interesting, but realistic enough that you have some hope of answering it. Maybe your beautiful question will focus on creating a more fulfilled, more curious, more interesting you.

Like "How do I stay Inspired?"
### Questions as a Compass
There is no definite answer, at least not for the creative individual who wants to keep growing, improving, innovating. To say I figured it out "this is what I do" and "how I do it", is to play it safe and risk everything.

What if we cultivated ignorance instead of fearing it?

We have a tool we have had since childhood that will help us dig, uncover, plant, tend and grow.
### Questions:
#### Chapter 5 "Questioning for Life" 
- What is my beautiful question?
- How do I experiment to change my career?
