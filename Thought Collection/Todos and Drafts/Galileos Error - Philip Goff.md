### What Physics Actually Tells Us & Eddington's solution

**Eddington's Core Claim:** Physics is fundamentally a **predictive tool**, not an ontological description.
- Physics = predictive tool (equations describe causal structure)
- Physics doesn't tell us _what things are_, only _what they do_

- Eddington says that: "An electron must have an intrinsic nature"
- Presented as _intuitive_ ("intuitively there must be more to what an electron is than what it does")
- The inference: Physics tells us what electrons _do_ → therefore something is missing → that something is intrinsic nature

The argument for consciousness as the intrinsic nature:

Physics describes ONLY causal/relational structure
         ↓
Structure requires something structured (intrinsic natures must exist)
         ↓
Physics is silent on what those intrinsic natures are
         ↓
We have direct access to ONE intrinsic nature: consciousness (via introspection)
         ↓
Consciousness is the only candidate for filling the gap
         ↓
Therefore: Consciousness IS the intrinsic nature of (some) matter


Assumptions:
- That intrinsic natures **must exist** (maybe relations go all the way down—structural realism)
- That we need **something beneath** the causal structure (maybe the structure is self-supporting)
- That "intrinsic nature" is even a coherent concept (maybe it's a confused question)

### Dualism critique

**Goff's Bottom Line:**

> "Returning to the question at hand, if dualism can't account for mind-brain interaction, then it should be rejected for that reason. But even if it can, dualism is less simple and hence less attractive than other solutions to the problem of consciousness."

**The Comparative Scorecard:**

|Theory|Substances|Interaction Problem|Simplicity|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Dualism**|Two (mind + matter)|Unsolved or requires quantum speculation|Complex|
|**Materialism**|One (matter)|No interaction needed|Simple but can't explain consciousness|
|**Panpsychism**|One (matter = conscious)|No interaction needed (unified)|Simple and explains consciousness|

If immaterial minds move material brains, then brain activity would constantly have **no physical explanation**—as if a ghost were continuously interfering with the machinery.

### Galileos worldview

In Galileo’s reimagined world, material objects have only the following characteristics:

- Size 
- Shape 
- Location
- Motion

Hence, for Galileo, the lemon I see in front of me isn’t really yellow, and it doesn’t really have a citrus smell and a sour taste. In reality the lemon is simply a thing which has a certain size, shape, and location. Of course, the lemon has parts, and there will be a great deal of complexity involved in the arrangement of and the relationship between these parts. But all of that complexity can, according to Galileo, be wholly characterized in terms of the sparse characteristics mentioned above: size, shape, location, and movement. What is so special about the characteristics of size, shape, location, and movement? The crucial point is that these characteristics can be captured in mathematics.

Consider the age-old philosophical conundrum, “If a tree falls in a forest, and there’s nobody there to hear it, does it make a sound?” In Galileo’s reimagining of the world, the answer is a clear and resounding no. The falling tree produces vibrations in the air, vibrations which have the mathematical characteristics of size, shape, location, and motion.
