Based on Boyd's OODA loop and complex adaptive systems thinking, here are practical measures to embrace uncertainty

## **Structural Measures**

**Build Redundancy, Not Efficiency:** Create multiple pathways to achieve the same outcome. Don't optimize away all "waste" - that redundancy becomes critical when systems fail unexpectedly.

**Maintain Loose Coupling:** Design systems where failure in one component doesn't cascade. Keep dependencies minimal and replaceable.

**Create Fast Feedback Loops:** Deploy small experiments quickly to get real-world data rather than trying to plan perfectly. This is why Boyd emphasized rapid OODA cycling.

## **Cognitive/Behavioral Measures**

**Practice "Strong Opinions, Loosely Held":** Form clear hypotheses but be ready to abandon them quickly when evidence contradicts them. Boyd called this "intellectual honesty."

**Develop Multiple Mental Models:** Don't rely on single frameworks. Cross-train your thinking across disciplines (your interest in Peterson, Weinstein, AI, and systems thinking already does this).

**Bias Toward Action Over Analysis:** When facing uncertainty, small actions often reveal more than extensive planning. Boyd's "synthesis" over "analysis" principle.

## **Tactical Applications**

**Pre-Mortems Instead of Predictions:** Instead of trying to predict what will happen, imagine what could go wrong and build responses. Taleb's "negative via" approach.

**Portfolio Approaches:** Don't put all resources into one strategy. Small bets across multiple approaches (mirrors your learning across Go, AI, systems).

**Time-Boxing Decisions:** Set deadlines for decision-making to prevent analysis paralysis. Boyd emphasized that being approximately right quickly beats being precisely right slowly.

**Environmental Design:** Create conditions where you can adapt quickly - liquid savings, transferable skills, loose commitments that don't lock you into rigid paths.

## **For Your AI/Systems Context**

**Build Observable Systems:** You can't adapt to what you can't see. Heavy instrumentation and logging in code.

**Embrace Failure as Data:** Design systems to fail fast and provide learning rather than trying to prevent all failures.


## Via negativa in practice

Exactly - you've identified the key distinction. Via negativa is about systematically removing **known harmful elements**, not trying to predict black swans.

**Examples of "Obvious" Harmful Elements:**
- **Code:** Remove unnecessary dependencies, complex abstractions, or tight coupling
- **Decision-making:** Remove time pressure when possible, remove ego from technical decisions
- **Information diet:** Remove low-signal sources (which is what you're doing by curating your content)
- **Systems:** Remove single points of failure, remove manual processes prone to human error
