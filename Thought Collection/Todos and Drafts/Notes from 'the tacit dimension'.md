## ch1 Tacit knowledge

Thinking is not only about having a special goal or purpose but it is connected to the things on which it based on. Thinking has a from-to structure, meaning that it involves a connection between where it starts and where it is going.

-----

We have to recognise, regarding human knowledge, that we know more than we can tell.

-----

Gestalt psychology has shown that we can understand someone's facial features as a whole, even if we cannot identify each individual part. Polinskyi’s study of knowledge is closely related to this idea from Gestalt psychology.

-----

The process of shaping or integrating our experiences is a powerful and essential part of how we discover and understand new knowledge, and how we come to believe it is true.

-----

~~We can only understand the first part of what is tacitly known by using our awareness of it to pay attention to what it relates to.

-----

(An example of functional and phenomenal aspects.)
*But there is a significance in the relation of the two terms of tacit knowing which combines its functional and phenomenal aspects. When the sight of certain syllables makes us expect an electric shock, we may say that they signify the approach of a shock. This is their meaning to us. We could say, therefore, that when shock syllables arouse an apprehension in us, without our being able to identify the syllables which arouse it, we know these syllables only in terms of their meaning. It is their meaning to which our attention is directed. It is in terms of their meaning that they enter into the appearance of that to which we are attending from them.*

-----

~~There are differet aspects to tacit knowledge according to Polanyi:

- ~~**The functional** - the way it operates or the purpose it serves

- ~~**The phenomenal** - what is subjectively experienced

- ~~**The semantic** - its meaning or interpretation

- ~~**The ontological** - the fundamental characteristics of the thing in question, and how it relates to other things and to the world as a whole

-----

The most important tool we have for gaining knowledge about things outside ourself is our body. Whenever we are awake and paying attention to things, we rely on our awareness of how our body is interacting with those things to understand them. We usually don't experience our own body as an object, but rather as a way of connecting to and understanding the world around us.

-----


When we use certain things to pay attention to other things, in the same way that we use our own body, those things change how they appear to us. They seem connected to the things that we are paying attention to, just like our body seems connected to the things outside of ourselves that we are paying attention to. In this way, when we use something as part of our "tacit knowing" process, it becomes a part of us, or an extension of our own body, and we feel like we are "dwelling" in it.

-----

When we accept moral teachings and make them a part of who we are, we are said to have "interiorized" them. This means we apply them in our actions and decision-making as if they are a natural part of us. Similarly, when we use a scientific theory to understand the world around us, we have "interiorized" it. We use the theory to interpret what we see and understand it in the context of the theory.

-----

Sometimes, analyzing a text very closely and breaking it down into smaller parts can help us understand it better. But this intense examination can also make it difficult to appreciate the text as a whole. However, when we carefully study the details of a text, it can help us integrate those details and come to a more complete and accurate understanding of their meaning.

-----

For example, you can learn to use a machine well without fully understanding how it works. However, an engineer who knows how the machine is built and how it operates has a deeper understanding of it. Similarly, we all have some basic knowledge of how our own bodies work, but a physiologist who studies the body in detail has a more complete and theoretical understanding of it.

-----

﻿Suppose that tacit thought forms an indispensable part of all knowledge, then the ideal of eliminating all personal elements of knowledge would, in effect, aim at the destruction of all knowledge. 

-----

~~We can only create a mathematical theory by using our previous understanding and experiences, and we can only use a mathematical theory by applying it to our previous experiences. Therefore, the idea of a mathematical theory of experience that completely removes personal understanding and experiences is self-contradictory and not logical.

-----

It seems that when we say that a statement is true, we understand more about it than we can explain. This means that when we find a solution to a problem, it often leads to more questions and unknowns. When we accept a discovery as true, we are also accepting all the potential consequences, even if we don't know what they are yet or can't even imagine them.


-----

The challenge is to find a way to have a more reliable understanding of things, instead of relying on the ideal of objectivity. This is what the theory of tacit knowledge should help us achieve.

## ch. 2 Emergence

When we try to understand someone's skill or strategy, we enter their mindset and try to understand what they were thinking. We do this by imagining doing the skill ourselves or by thinking about the game they played. In both cases, we try to understand the person's actions and the way they fit together. We have to recognize that there is a coordinated performance happening before we can try to understand it. We also try to identify the important parts of the performance and how they fit together. We don't just observe someone's actions, we try to understand them and the person behind them. Sometimes it's hard to understand all the details of what someone is doing, even after we have learned a lot about it.

-----

We don't just automatically understand someone's mind. We have to try to understand it by looking for clues and trying to piece them together. This is like how a scientist investigates something. Some of the clues we use may be hard to explain or even be unconscious.

-----

We should not think of understanding someone's mind as being separate from understanding other things. We can also understand inanimate objects by looking at their parts and understanding how they fit together.

-----

"To understand something without talking about it, we need to be aware of the details of that thing. But if we focus too much on the details, we lose sight of the bigger picture. This is also true for a comprehensive entity, like a game of chess. The game is controlled by certain principles that depend on following the rules of chess, but these principles cannot be explained just by the rules themselves. Understanding something without talking about it, and the thing itself, are like two levels of reality, each with its own principles. The higher level relies on the lower level, but cannot be fully explained by it."

-----

Even though biologists say they want to explain all life based on the laws of physics and chemistry, they actually try to do this by using a machine based on those laws. They think they can explain the machine with the laws of physics. However, this is not true

-----

Machines are made up of inanimate matter that follows the laws of physics and chemistry. However, machines can also have their own rules (operational principles) that they follow. These rules are created by humans and are imposed on the inanimate matter of the machine. The machine's operational principles and the laws of nature both affect how the machine works. The operational principles provide specific rules for the machine to follow, while the laws of nature provide general guidelines. Engineering helps to determine the specific rules (boundary conditions) that the machine should follow. This means that the machine is subject to two sets of rules: the natural laws that govern all matter and the artificial rules (operational principles) that are specific to the machine.

-----

Inanimate (non-living) things are self-contained and do not rely on anything or have any goals. They always follow the rules of nature and do not make mistakes. This is different from living things, which can have goals and may or may not be successful in achieving them. Things that have goals or purpose (like living things) have a value that cannot be explained by things that do not have goals. We cannot understand things that have purpose by only looking at things that do not have purpose. Therefore, something new and not present in inanimate things must be at work when life is created.

-----

As we study more complex animals, we develop higher standards for how they should behave and function. We also become more connected to the animals as we study them. We understand animals (including humans) by observing their behavior and recognizing that their actions have meaning. Even at the most basic level, we recognize that animals have their own interests and these shape our own interest in them. All of biology is about this connection between us and the animals we study. As animals become more like humans in their behavior and emotions, we become more emotionally connected to them. We recognize their ability to feel and think and we understand their emotional connections to us.
