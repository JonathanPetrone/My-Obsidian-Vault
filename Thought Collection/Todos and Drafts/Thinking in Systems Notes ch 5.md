Being less surprised by complex systems is about learning expectations regarding complexity. 

System trouble can be talked about as behavior archetypes. System traps can be escaped by strategies.

### Policy Resistance
Policy resistance comes from bounded rationalities of the actors in a system, each with their own goals. So the actors do actions to correct a situation.

In a policy-resistant system with actors pulling in different directions, everyone has to put great effort in keeping the system where no on wants it to be.

**Dealing with it:**
- Overpower the resistance, if you have the power to do it. But if you let up power it can cause explosive consequences.
- You could let go, some resistance might be to the inefficient policy
- The most effective way is to find a way to align the different subsystems, usually by providing an overarching goal that allow all actors to break out of their bounded rationality.

### The Tragedy of the Commons
This is about escalation or growth in a commonly shared, and erodable environment.

The more users there are the more the resource is used. The more its used the less resource for each user. Users can have their bounded rationality ("No reason for me to limit my usage"). Overusage continues, erosion happens and eventually the resource is destroyed.

**Dealing with it:**
- Educate and exhort
- Privatize the commons
- Regulate the commons

You could have mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon. -> Traffic lights
### Drift to Low Performance
The desired state of the system is influenced by the perceived state. This is because often standards aren't absolute. There could be eroding goals.

**Dealing with it:**
- Keep standards more absolute
- Let standards be enhanced by the best performers instead of getting discouraged by the worst

### Escalation
An example of escalation is kids hitting each others with more force. Escalation is about a reinforcing feedback loop, leading to exponential growth.

**Dealing with it:**
- Refuse to compete
- Negotiate a new system with balancing loops too control escalation

### Success to the Successful - Competitive exclusion
"To him that hath shall be given", the more the winner wins the more he, she or it can win in the future.

**Dealing with it:**
- Diversification by the losing player
- Policies that level the playing field

### Addiction - Shifting the Burden to the Intervenor
Addiction arises when a solution to a systematic problem reduces (or disguises) the symptoms, but does nothing to solve the underlying problem.

The system will become more dependent on the interventions and less able to maintain its own desired state.

**Dealing with it:**
- Don't get caught in it
- Long term restructuring, no short term relief.

### Rule Beating
Rule beating means evasive action to get around the intent of a systems rules. abiding by the letter, but not the spirit of the law.

**Dealing with it:**
- Design or redesign to release the creativity not in the direction of beating the rules, but in the direction of achieving the purpose of the rules.

### Seeking the Wrong Goal
System behavior is particularly sensitive to the goals of feedback loops. If the goals are defined inaccurately or incompletely the system may obediently work to produce a result that is not really intended or wanted.

**Dealing with it:**
- Specify indicators or goals that reflect the real welfare of the system. 
- Do not confuse effort with result, otherwise the system will produce effort not result.
