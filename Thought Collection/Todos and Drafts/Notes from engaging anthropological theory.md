## chapter 1

- p. 1, Franz Boas has a four field emplhasis to anthropology, cultural anthropology, linguistics, archaeology, physical anthropology.

- p. 2, Donna Haraway on ideas and culture, knowledge is always engaged in material practice and never a disembodied set of ideas. 
  
  Knowledge is embedded in projects; knowledge is always for, in many senses some things and not others, and knowers are always formed by their projects, just as they shape what they know.

- p.7, Five assumptions about the scientist and the process of observation:
	- objectivity
	- observational consensus
	- replicability
	- induction -> no pre-conceived notion about what is observed
	- scientific progress

These assumptions were abandoned long ago by philosophers of science.

- p. 9, David Hume pointed out logical fallacies with empiricist claims to knowledge. 
	- The fallacy of selectivity
	- The fallacy of objectivity

- p. 13, Falsifiability (K. Popper), is to be able to prove something to be false, but we can only prove it to be false and not to that it is true.

- p. 14, Popper argued that scientist could weed out incorrect theories and leave one provisionally accepted theory.

- p. 16-17, Paradigm, a paradigm is a set of dominant beliefs within a field that establishes standards of scientific investigation. According to Thomas Kuhn, switching paradigms isn't just about accumulating contradicting knowledge, it's about a system of beliefs overthrowing another.

- p. 19 Sapir & Whorff, language and linguistics form how we think, they have a linguistic relativity theory.

- p. 20 Kuhn has a relativistic stance towards epistemology. Truth is seen as relative to the person describing it.
