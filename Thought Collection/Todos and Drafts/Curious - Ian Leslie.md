# Part one - How Curiousity Works
## Notes Foreword and Chapter 1 

Paying attention -> Then asking questions -> (leads to) things becoming more interesting

Order has a tendency to suppress curiousity.

Curious people go deep, and they go wide. They have a strong intrinsic desire to learn, solve problems, and ask penetrating questions.

Knowledge-rich, cognitive challenging work, are less likely replaced by AI.

We can measure curiousity in need for cognition:
	- Low (Low cognitive activities require little effort)
	- High (High cognitive activities require lots of effort)

Different types of curiousities in the book:
- Diverse curiousity (High diversive curiousity can be a risk factor, in that it enables risky behavior)
- Epistemic curiousity
- Empathic curiousity

Knowledge builds knowledge.

Curious people take risks, they try things out, which allows them to become productively distracted.

Information has a fast quality to it, knowledge has a slow quality.

People who are deeply curious are more likely to be good at collaboration, they seek out new acquaintances in the process of building cultural knowledge.
### Questions:
#### Foreword and Chapter 1
- What are the definitions of the different type of curiousities outlined in the book?
- How do we differentiate between information and Knowledge?
- How do we absorb knowledge rather than information?

## Notes Chapter 2

Children experiment with senses and asks questions. Naugthiness of infants is experimental and a way to collect data.

Curiousity over time for kids become more dependent on adults.

Every question you ask can be thought of as a bet.

Asking questions is an amazing skill:
1. Conceive your own ignorance
2. Imagine different possibilities
3. Understand that you can learn from others

### Questions:
####  Chapter 2
- What senses could I employ more of to explore and learn better?
- How is my environment affecting my curiousity?
- How can I remind myself to ask questions?

## Notes Chapter 3

As we grow we become less curious, but its useful too, we become more able to act instead of getting fascinated by every stimuli.

Freud thought of curiousity as a drive for information, similar to the sex drive in humans.

#### Curiousity and Surprise
Piaget on the other hand viewed curiousity as a way to make sense of the world. Meaning the incongruity with regards to expectation vs. reality.

#### Curiousity and Knowledge
Daniel Berlyne says curiousity is paradoxical as it is stimulated by understanding and the absence of understanding.

If we know nothing about a subject we have a hard time to engage. However the more we know about something the more intense our curiousity about something we don't know yet, especially if we feel it will be insightful.

#### Curiousity and CONFIDENCE

To feel the desire of closing the knowledge gap you have to be aware of the gap. However inbalance in confidence whether too high or too low affects curiousity negatively.

#### Puzzles vs. Mysteries

The author talks about Puzzles vs. Mysteries:
- Puzzles:
	- Have definite answer
	- Questions like, HOW MANY or WHERE?
	- Linked to goals
- Mysteries:
	- Indefinite answers
	- Questions like, WHY or HOW?
	- Linked to possibilities

We have a human bias towards puzzles, scientists operate around mysteries. Physicist Freeman Dyson has remarked that science is not a collection of truths, but “a continuing exploration of mysteries.”

#### DifficultIEs
Internet leads (points to) to fast answers and "truth", however we learn better when it's difficult, when we have to actively bridge the knowledge gap. Easy answers leads to less questions.

Robert Bjork talked about the concept "Desirable difficulties"

### Questions:
####  Chapter 3
- Are analogies a tool for us to cultivate curiousity? (linked to D. Berlyne and the concept of knowledge effect and relationship to curiousity)
- How can I work with Surprise, Knowledge, and Confidence to optimize my curiousity?
- How can I incorporate desirable difficulties in my own learning?
- Do I choose mysteries over puzzles?

# Part Two - The Curiousity Divide

## Notes Chapter 4

The ancient greeks, talked about "curiousitas", pursuit of knowledge for it own sake. The romans inherited this concept too.

People used to bring back items in the 17th century. as a way to display cultural taste, expertise and gain status.

The age of enlightenment was about becoming enlightened rather then being enlightened.

Empathic curiousity can grow and expand when exposed to -> literature, fiction, and drama.
People have been shown to become more emotionally intelligent after exposure to fiction etc.

Accidental learning -> Serendipity

Epistemic curiousity -> Scientific
Diverse curiousity -> Novelty

Curiousity is in peril again, due to abundance of information.

"Machine are for answers, Humans are for questions."

Compression of information ABC...

**The Memex Machine**
	Association of data
	Follow trails

Bush (Memex Machine) had anticipated the structure of the internet.

Curiousity is about demand and supply of information, what we want, how we feel about it, and what we invest (time, effort). It involves discrimination. 

The internet is problematic sometimes as it tends to give us answers faster than we can forumlate follow-up questions.

What do I want to learn is a hard question.

Curiousity is sustained by unanswered questions.

We are moving towards consensus (Effect of google)

The internet has potential to open our minds to new knowledge, but this potential is often untapped.
### Questions:
####  Chapter 4
- In the past we rose up against the church with curiousity and enlightenment, where is the battle today and should we use curiousity as a weapon too?
- Is serendipity dependent on our attention?

### Notes Chapter 5
There are rising disparities (2012) between young adults with or without college degrees.

Regarding traits that have positive benefits is in regards to intelligence, conscientiousness pops out, but also intellectual curiousity.

Raw Intelligence is about as powerful as curiousity and conscientiousness combined.

#### Different stages of curiousity
1. Childrens instinctual exploration
2. Social curiousity and assimilation of information
3. Deepening of bond between the individual and the world (curiousity is "transformed into interest in problems provoked by the observation of things and the accumulation of material")

### Questions:
####  Chapter 5
- Sophie von Stumm, is intellectual curiousity the same as openness to experience in the big 5?

## Notes Chapter 6

Questions are places in your mind where answers fit. If you haven't asked the question the answer has nowhere to go.

Question asking is a sophisticated skill, we learn it through osmosis from those around us.

The capacity to ask questions is unequally distributed.

Question asking is fundamental to be human.

Middle-class parents ask their children more so in turn the children ask more back too.

Middle-class -> Focused on concentrated cultivation
Working-class -> Natural growth style

A lot of bad leadership comes from an inability or unwillingness to ask questions.
> ...The dumbest questions unlock conversations

In bureaucracies there is an incentive for senior managers to stop asking questions. Ignorance becomes power. Retention of power is an end goal.

In companies success can stop innovation, there forms a resistance to innovate in order to protect success.

**"Questions are the best weapons of the weak against the strong"**

#### FOur reasons to not ask questions:
1. Protecting ourselves from looking stupid
2. We are too busy
3. The culture discourages questioning
4. We lack the skills to ask them

"Just when you think you know all you need to know, you ask another question and discover how much more there is to learn"

### Questions:
####  Chapter 6
- How can we learn to ask better questions
- How can we ask dumb questions in a safer way?
- Why does bureaucracies have a tendency towards having incentives to stop asking questions?
- How can I utilize questions as a weapon for change?
- Are there mitigations for the four reasons not to ask questions? What are they?

## Notes Chapter 7

In the absence of knowledge imported by adults, childrens natural curiousity takes them only so far. Teachers help children stumble across areas of knowledge that they didn't know they were interested in. Good teachers direct the curiousity of students.

Researchers who study innovation have found that the average age at which scientists and inventors make breakthroughs increase over time.

The wider your knowledge, the more widely your intelligence can range and the more purchase it gets on new information.

Long-term memory. is the hidden power behind the throne of cognition. The more complex the mental operation, the bigger role it plays.

Curiousity, like other thinking skills, cannot be nurtured or taught in the abstract. Rather than being stifled by factual knowledge, it depends on it.

The most important contributor to future success is not intelligence rather what the person knows.

Knowledge is subject to the Matthew effect:
“For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.”

In education curiousity is both undervalued and overpriced.

Knowing stuff makes the world more abundant with possibility.

### Questions:
####  Chapter 7
- How can I improve long-term memory retention?
- How can I make the Matthew effect work for me?

# Part Three -  Staying Curious

## Notes Chapter 8

### 1. Stay Foolish
One of the most important and difficult questions for any organization, especially those whose success depends on staying abreast of technological change, is how to inculcate a spirit of curiosity into its executives and employees.

To push for more curiousity we could:
- Look outward and explore
- Create incentives
- Stay hungry

Success is often not good for curiousity.
### 2. Build Database
"A technique for producing ideas" from Young

1. Gather raw material, in many areas of information
2. "Working over", looking at the gathered facts
3. "No effort of directed nature", do something else
4. Sleep and let the unconscious mind do work (Dreaming can help the brain make connections)
5. The idea is prodded, tested and massaged into reality

Highly curious people, who have cultivated their long-term memories, live in a kind of augmented reality; everything is overlaid with additional layers of meaning and possibility, unavailable to ordinary people.

Building a database is the surest way to producing ideas that will someday be part of someone else's database.

### 3. Forage Like a Foxhog
Isiah Berlin proposed that there are two different categories of people, those who look at the world through the lens of one particular idea and those who revel in a variety of perspectives.

Foxes (Many perspectives) vs. Hedgehog (One idea)

We need to be a combination, the author calls this a "foxhog", same as what IBM calls "T-Shaped Knowledge"

### 4. Asking the Big Why
We can tend to avoid asking penetrating questions, as it can be construed as bad manners or it can make us look bad.

"If you ask what people's underlying interests are, what do they need- then you are more likely to get to find an imaginative solution"

We often ask the WHAT instead of the WHY, as WHAT is measurable.

The trend of Big Data reveals this trend as well.

Knowing the WHAT will always be important to make progress, but asking WHY will always be important to ask as well.
### 5. Be a Thinkerer
"Thinkerer" is a portmanteau of think and tinker.

It's about combining thinking with experiments. Experiments are often reinforced by knowledge.

Steve Jobs was a thinkerer. The people responsible for our biggest ideas usually are details freak too.

It's easy in current society with the internet to skip and skim along the top line of everything. We need ned to make an effort to be thinkering.

### 6. Question you Teaspoons
NOTE: Look up the boring conference

The transformative power of attention has the ability to turn anything interesting eventually. (Ward)

Ward is also an admirer of the French writer Georges Perec, who was interested in the infra-ordinary, which is the opposite of the extraordinary. Perec urged his readers to "question your teaspoons"

We can all find ways to make the mundane into something that stimulates our curiousity.

Motivation is often assumed to come from the future. But the goal-setting focused approach to motivation has its problems because when we set our sights on the future, we are less likely to enjoy the present.

### 7. Turn Puzzles into Mysteries

A puzzle is something that commands our attention until we solve it. A mystery never stops inviting inquiry. Often we turn problems into puzzles. However, if we create mysteries we can create life-long passions.

Example:
Fundamental principle of Cryptology is that anything can signify anything.

Meaning can reside in the most unlikely of places.
### Questions:
####  Chapter 8
- How can I create a curious culture around me?
- How can I use my sleep to allow for serendipity?
- What is my deep knowledge? How am I like a foxhog?
- How can I ask penetrating questions more often, in a effective manner? 
- How can I integrate tinkering in my learning?
- How can I create a habit to enjoy the present more?
- Which mystery if any is on my mind?
