## Feedback dynamics
The information delivered by a feedback even nonphysical feedback can only affect future behavior, it cant deliver a signal fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback, meaning flow cant react instantly to flow.

A stock maintaining balancing feedback loop must have its goal set up appropriately to compensate for draining or inflowing processes that effect that stock.

When one loop dominates another it has a stronger impact on behavior of the system. This can be called shifting dominance in feedback loops.

Complex behaviors of systems often arise as the relative strengths of the feedback loops shift, causing first one loop and then another to dominate behavior.
### Modelling system dynamics
When we try to model systems, via system dynamic models, we explore different possible futures and ask "what if" questions
#### Questions for testing the value of a model:
1. Are the driving factors likely to unfold this way?
2. If they did, would the system react this way?
3. What are the driving factors?

A model's utility depends not on whether driving scenarios are realistic (since no one can know that for sure) but on whether it responds with a realistic pattern of behavior.

Systems with similar feedback structures produces similar dynamic behaviors.

A delay in a balancing feedback loop makes a system likely to oscillate.

”Delays are pervasive in systems, and they are strong determinants of behavior. Changing the length of a delay may (or may not, depending on the type of delay and the relative lengths of other delays) make a large change in the behavior of a system.”

76 two stock systems

”In physical, exponentially growing systems, there must be at least one reinforcing loop driving the growth and at least one balancing loop constraining the growth, because no physical system can grow forever in a finite environment.”

”Nonrenewable resources are stock-limited. The entire stock is available at once, and can be extracted at any rate (limited mainly by extraction capital). But since the stock is not renewed, the faster the extraction rate, the shorter the lifetime of the resource.

Renewable resources are flowlimited. They can support extraction or harvest indefinitely, but only at a finite flow rate equal to their regeneration rate. If they are extracted faster than they regenerate, they may eventually be driven below a critical threshold and become, for all practical purposes, nonrenewable.”
