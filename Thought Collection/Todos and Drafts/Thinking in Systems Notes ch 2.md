## Feedback dynamics
The information delivered by a feedback loop—even nonphysical feedback—can only affect future behavior. It can't deliver a signal fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback, meaning flows can't react instantly to other flows.

A stock-maintaining balancing feedback loop must have its goal set appropriately to compensate for draining or inflowing processes that affect that stock.

## Shifting Dominance
When one loop dominates another, it has a stronger impact on system behavior. This is called **shifting dominance** in feedback loops.

**Complex behaviors of systems often arise as the relative strengths of feedback loops shift, causing first one loop and then another to dominate behavior.**

Example: In a population system, when birth rates exceed death rates, the reinforcing growth loop dominates. When death rates exceed birth rates, the balancing death loop dominates.

## System Delays
**A delay in a balancing feedback loop makes a system likely to oscillate.**

Delays are pervasive in systems and are strong determinants of behavior. Changing the length of a delay may make a large change in system behavior, though this depends on the type of delay and relative lengths of other delays.

Examples of delays:

- Time between catching a disease and getting sick
- Time for pollution to affect ecosystems
- Gestation periods in animal populations
- Time to retool production systems

## Exponential Growth and Constraints
**Key insight about growth:** In physical, exponentially growing systems, there must be at least one reinforcing loop driving growth AND at least one balancing loop constraining growth, because no physical system can grow forever in a finite environment.

**Exponential growth rule:** The time for an exponentially growing stock to double equals approximately 70 divided by the growth rate (as a percentage).
- Example: 7% growth = 10 years to double (70 ÷ 7 = 10)

## Two-Stock Systems and Resource Constraints
**Nonrenewable vs. Renewable Resources:**

- **Nonrenewable resources are stock-limited** - The entire stock is available at once and can be extracted at any rate (limited mainly by extraction capital). The faster the extraction rate, the shorter the resource lifetime.
- **Renewable resources are flow-limited** - They can support extraction indefinitely, but only at a finite flow rate equal to their regeneration rate. If extracted faster than they regenerate, they may be driven below a critical threshold and become effectively nonrenewable.

**Critical insight:** A quantity growing exponentially toward a limit reaches that limit in surprisingly short time. Doubling or quadrupling a resource only adds about 14 years to its lifetime under exponential extraction.

## Modeling System Dynamics
System dynamics models explore possible futures and ask "what if" questions.

### Questions for testing the value of a model:
1. Are the driving factors likely to unfold this way?
2. If they did, would the system react this way?
3. What is driving the driving factors?

**Model utility depends not on whether driving scenarios are realistic (since no one can know that for sure), but on whether it responds with a realistic pattern of behavior.**

**Key principle:** Systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic behaviors, even if they look completely different on the surface.
