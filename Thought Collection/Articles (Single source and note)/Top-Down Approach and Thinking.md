## Core Concept/Principle:
Starts with the big picture, then breaks down into smaller segments. Essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion. An overview is formulated first, specifying but not detailing first-level subsystems, then each subsystem is refined in greater detail across multiple levels until reduced to base elements. Driven by pre-existing knowledge, expectations, or context.

## Context/Example:
System analysis begins with overall architecture understanding, then progressively decomposes into subsystems and components. Applied across multiple domains: 

- **Cognitive Psychology** (conceptually-driven perception using mental frameworks)
- **Information Processing** (context and prior knowledge influencing data interpretation)
- **Problem-Solving** (starting with overall solution framework then adapting smaller elements)
- **AI/Computer Science** (structured rules and algorithms interpreting data).
