Cem Kaner defines a software testing oracle as a tool that tells you whether the program passed your test. Oracles tend to be [[heuristic]] (A decision rule that is useful but not always correct), therefore if we rely on oracles we might fall into the trap of:

-   Believing the program has passed even though it did something wrong.
-   Believing the program has failed even though it has behaved appropriately.

Software testing oracles are incomplete in their nature as we can’t fully specify the postcondition state of the system under test, therefore no oracle we can use is “complete” in itself.

## Similar:
- **Test coverage analysis problems** Coverage analysis is similar because it shares the fundamental issue of incompleteness that defines the oracle problem. Both involve:
	- Inability to be completely comprehensive
	- Uncertainty about adequacy
	- Need for heuristic approaches to determine sufficiency Like the oracle problem, determining if test coverage is "enough" is inherently heuristic and potentially incomplete.

## Opposite: 
- **Binary pass/fail conditions** The oracle problem highlights how test results often exist in a gray area where we can't be 100% certain if the behavior is correct or incorrect. 
- **Fully specified test requirements** One of the core aspects of the oracle problem is that we can't fully specify all postconditions and expected behaviors of a system. Fully specified test requirements represent the theoretical opposite - a situation where every possible outcome and behavior is completely defined ahead of time.

## Theme/Questions:
- How can we mitigate oracle reliability issues?
- What makes a good testing oracle?
- When should we trust/distrust oracle results?
## What does this lead to?
- Development of better testing strategies
- Combination of multiple oracle approaches
- More sophisticated test validation methods
