Explicit knowledge can be easily articulated, shared, and codified in words, numbers, diagrams, or symbols. Explicit knowledge is formalized, objective, and can be transmitted through teaching, documents, books, or digital media.

Whereas tacit knowledge is intuitive and personal, explicit knowledge is structured, rule-based, and more universally understood. Think of it as the knowledge we can clearly describe or "tell"â€”for example, instructions on how to assemble furniture, mathematical formulas, or historical facts. Together, these two dimensions form a complete understanding of knowledge: explicit knowledge provides the details we can convey, while tacit knowledge includes the intuitive or experiential understanding that deepens our grasp of those details.
