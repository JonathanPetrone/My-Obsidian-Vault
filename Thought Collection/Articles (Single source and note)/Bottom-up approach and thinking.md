The bottom-up approach is a type of information processing based on incoming data from the environment to form a perception. When we use a bottom-up approach we piece together systems to give rise to more complex systems, thus making the original systems sub-systems of the emergent system. 

In a bottom-up approach the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. 

For example, when you perceive an object (like a tree), you might start by noticing individual leaves, branches, and the texture of the bark (smaller subsystems), and through this, you eventually perceive the whole tree (the larger system).

This strategy often resembles a "seed" model, by which the beginnings are small but eventually grow in complexity and completeness.

- **Cognitive Psychology**:
These approaches explain how humans **process sensory information** and form perceptions. In cognitive psychology, **bottom-up processing** is data-driven, starting from sensory input to construct perception, while **top-down processing** is conceptually driven, starting from mental frameworks and prior knowledge to interpret sensory data.

- **Information Processing**:
In information processing theory, these approaches describe how information is absorbed, analyzed, and understood. **Bottom-up processing** refers to receiving and analyzing raw data (such as visual or auditory stimuli), while **top-down processing** is influenced by context, memory, and prior knowledge to make sense of that data.

- **Problem-Solving and Decision-Making**:
In fields like **systems theory** or **problem-solving**, these approaches describe strategies for understanding complex systems or making decisions. A **bottom-up approach** might involve analyzing individual elements or smaller problems before forming a solution to the whole, while a **top-down approach** would start with an overall solution or framework and then adapt the smaller elements to fit.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Science**:
These terms are also relevant in AI and programming. In **machine learning**, for example, bottom-up processing can be seen in data-driven models that build understanding from raw input, while top-down models might apply structured rules or algorithms to interpret the data.
