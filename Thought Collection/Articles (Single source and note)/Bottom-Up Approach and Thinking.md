## Core Concept/Principle:
Information processing based on incoming data from the environment to form perception. Individual base elements are first specified in detail, then linked together to form larger subsystems, which connect across multiple levels until a complete top-level system emerges. This approach pieces together systems to create more complex systems, making original systems into subsystems of the emergent whole.

## Context/Example:
Perceiving a tree starts by noticing individual leaves, branches, and bark texture (smaller subsystems), eventually forming perception of the whole tree (larger system). Resembles a "seed" model where beginnings are small but grow in complexity and completeness. Applied across multiple domains: **Cognitive Psychology** (data-driven sensory processing), **Information Processing** (analyzing raw data before interpretation), **Problem-Solving** (analyzing individual elements before forming whole solutions), **AI/Computer Science** (data-driven models building understanding from raw input).
