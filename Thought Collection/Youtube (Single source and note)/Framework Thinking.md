Framework thinking is about actively noticing and structuring information in order to understand how the world works. Frameworks are basically simplified representations of how the world works so by categorizing and simplifying things down to some key levers, similar to first principles.

## The science behind framework thinking

Two ways our brain organizes information to be retrievable:

- Sequential memory
	- Like step for step...
- Relational memory
	- How something relates to another thing...

We then have three types of relational categories:
- Visual
- Functional
- Conceptual (...for a specific situation)

Actively map concepts and bare truths to specific situations to enhance knowledge and memory.
