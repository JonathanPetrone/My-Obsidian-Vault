## Core Concept/Principle:
To gather information effectively, let go of expectations - there's no right or wrong way. Start in "divergence mode" by opening horizons and exploring every possible option, letting curiosity guide exploration. When capturing notes, ask "how can I make this most useful for my future self?" This leads to annotation explaining why you saved it, what you were thinking, and what caught your attention. Separate capturing from organizing to avoid limiting resonance-based collection.

## Context/Example:
Information gathering involves clicking every link, jumping between sources, following curiosity without predetermined structure. Create breadcrumbs (references) for follow-up and store in knowledge systems.

The process fits the CODE model: 
- **Capture** (keep what resonates)
- **Organize** (save for actionability)
- **Distill** (find essence)
- **Express** (show your work). Divergence mode resembles the "scout obsessively" principle from buccaneer-scholar methodology.

## System Components:

- **Individual Elements**: Divergent exploration activities, resonance-based capture decisions, future-self annotations, reference breadcrumbs, and the separation between gathering and organizing phases
- **Interactions**: The flow from curiosity-driven exploration to selective capture to future-focused annotation; the feedback loop between what resonates now and what proves valuable later; the progression through CODE stages
- **Environment/Field**: The information landscape available for exploration, the knowledge management systems that enable capture and retrieval, the future contexts where captured information will be needed

## Applications:

- **Technical Research**: When exploring new testing frameworks or architecture patterns, follow interesting links without predetermined goals, capturing insights that resonate even if not immediately applicable to current projects
- **Industry Knowledge Building**: Scout technical blogs, conference talks, and research papers in divergent mode, annotating why specific insights caught your attention and how they might apply to debt collection technology challenges
- **Problem-Solving Resource Development**: Capture diverse solution approaches encountered during debugging or system analysis, noting the context and reasoning that made each approach interesting for future reference
- **Professional Development**: Gather insights from leadership articles, management techniques, and team development resources without forcing immediate categorization, focusing on what resonates with your experience and challenges
- **Architecture Learning**: Explore system design patterns across different industries and scales, capturing examples and principles that spark interest, with annotations about potential applications to your current systems
- **Meeting and Conversation Insights**: Capture interesting points from stakeholder discussions, team retrospectives, and informal conversations, noting why they stood out and potential future relevance
- **Cross-Domain Innovation**: Follow curiosity into adjacent fields (psychology, design, operations research) that might inform testing strategies or system approaches, capturing unexpected connections

## Questions/Next Steps:

- [ ] How can I better separate my information gathering from my urge to immediately organize and categorize?
- [ ] What annotation practices would make my captured information most useful for my future self?
- [ ] Where am I being too restrictive in my information gathering due to predetermined expectations?
