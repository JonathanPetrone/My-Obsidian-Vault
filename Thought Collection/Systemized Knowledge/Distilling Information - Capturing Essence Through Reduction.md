## Core Concept/Principle:
	"To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, remove things every day" - Lao Tzu. 

Distillation captures the most important aspects and essence of information. Each highlighting decision develops judgment by distinguishing truly important bits from those that don't matter. Value is not evenly distributed in content, making it crucial to capture just the bare minimum.

## Context/Example:
The more economical you can be with material captured in your knowledge system, the less time and effort your future self will need to process it again. 

- **Progressive Summarization** technique: highlight main points of a note, then highlight the main points of those highlights, creating layers of distillation that reveal core insights through iterative refinement.

## System Components:
- **Individual Elements**: Original content with uneven value distribution; highlighting and summarization decisions that reflect developing judgment; distilled essence that captures core insights
- **Interactions**: The progressive refinement process that moves from comprehensive to essential; the judgment development that occurs through repeated distillation decisions; the time-saving relationship between present effort and future efficiency
- **Environment/Field**: The knowledge management system that enables and rewards economical capture; the future context where distilled information must serve different needs and time constraints

## Connections:
- **Similar**: [[Progressive summarization]], [[Essential thinking]], [[Signal vs noise]], [[Minimum viable information]]
- **Opposite**: [[Information hoarding]], [[Comprehensive capture]], [[Equal-weight processing]], [[Kitchen sink documentation]]
- **Builds on**: [[Second Brain]], [[Future-proofing information]], [[CODE model]], [[Value recognition]]
- **Enables**: [[Efficient knowledge retrieval]], [[Clear communication]], [[Strategic thinking]], [[Wisdom development]]

## Applications:
- **Meeting Notes**: Capture decision rationale, action items, and key insights rather than full conversation transcripts, enabling quick review and follow-up
- **Learning Notes**: Extract fundamental principles, patterns, and actionable insights from technical books and courses rather than comprehensive summaries
## Questions/Next Steps:
- [ ]  Where am I capturing too much information at the expense of clear insight?
- [ ]  How can I develop better judgment for distinguishing essential from non-essential information?
- [ ]  What progressive summarization techniques would work best for my technical documentation?
