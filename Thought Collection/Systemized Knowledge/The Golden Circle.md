## Core Concept/Principle:
A three-layer communication model (Why → How → What) where inspirational leaders and organizations start with their purpose (WHY) rather than their products or methods. Money is viewed as a result, not the primary motivation. Most people communicate from WHAT they do, but inspiring communication flows from WHY they do it.

## Context/Example:
- **WHY**: Your core belief, purpose, or cause - the reason you exist beyond making money. 
- **HOW**: Your process, values, or differentiating principles - how you fulfill your purpose.
- **WHAT**: Your products, services, or tangible results - what you actually produce. Inspirational leaders communicate from inside-out (Why → How → What) rather than outside-in (What → How → Why).

## System Components:
- **Individual Elements**: Three distinct communication layers (Why, How, What) that each serve different motivational and informational functions, with varying emotional resonance
- **Interactions**: The flow from purpose through process to product creates coherent messaging; starting with WHY influences how people perceive and connect with HOW and WHAT
- **Environment/Field**: The communication context and audience relationship that determines whether purpose-driven messaging creates inspiration and trust or falls flat
