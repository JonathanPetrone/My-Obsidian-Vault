## Core Concept/Principle:

Information processing based on incoming data from the environment to form perception. Individual base elements are first specified in detail, then linked together to form larger subsystems, which connect across multiple levels until a complete top-level system emerges. This approach pieces together systems to create more complex systems, making original systems into subsystems of the emergent whole.

## Context/Example:

Perceiving a tree starts by noticing individual leaves, branches, and bark texture (smaller subsystems), eventually forming perception of the whole tree (larger system). Resembles a "seed" model where beginnings are small but grow in complexity and completeness. Applied across multiple domains: **Cognitive Psychology** (data-driven sensory processing), **Information Processing** (analyzing raw data before interpretation), **Problem-Solving** (analyzing individual elements before forming whole solutions), **AI/Computer Science** (data-driven models building understanding from raw input).

## System Components:

- **Individual Elements**: Base components specified in great detail that serve as foundational building blocks; raw sensory data, individual problems, or system components
- **Interactions**: The linking process that connects elements into subsystems; the emergent properties that arise when smaller systems combine into larger wholes; multiple levels of connection and integration
- **Environment/Field**: The context that provides incoming data and enables perception formation; the framework that supports progressive complexity growth from simple beginnings

## Connections:

- **Similar**: [[Emergent systems]], [[Data-driven analysis]], [[Inductive reasoning]], [[Component-based design]]
- **Opposite**: [[Top-Down Approach and Thinking]], [[Deductive reasoning]], [[Framework-first design]]
- **Builds on**: [[Systems theory]], [[Empirical observation]], [[Pattern recognition]]
- **Enables**: [[Emergent organization]], [[Complex system understanding]], [[Adaptive design]]

## Applications:

- **System Architecture Analysis**: Start with individual components (databases, APIs, services) and understand their interactions before grasping overall system behavior and emergent properties
- **Bug Investigation**: Begin with specific symptoms, error logs, and data points, then piece together patterns to understand larger system failures or architectural issues
- **Test Strategy Development**: Examine individual test cases, specific failure modes, and component behaviors before designing comprehensive testing approaches
- **Team Understanding**: Observe individual team member skills, working patterns, and interactions before forming strategies for team optimization and process improvement
- **Code Review Process**: Analyze specific code segments, individual functions, and component relationships before assessing overall architectural quality
- **Learning New Technologies**: Start with hands-on experimentation, specific examples, and concrete implementations before understanding broader frameworks and principles
- **Process Improvement**: Gather specific incidents, individual workflow observations, and detailed data points before proposing systematic changes

## Questions/Next Steps:

- [ ] Where am I jumping to high-level conclusions without sufficient bottom-up analysis?
- [ ] How can I better observe and document individual system components before making architectural decisions?
- [ ] What bottom-up investigation techniques would strengthen my problem-solving approach?
