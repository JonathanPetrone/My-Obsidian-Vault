## Core Concept/Principle:
Knowledge that can be easily documented, verbalized, and transferred through formal language. Systematic and codified information that enables ready sharing through various media like documents, databases, and formal training materials. Distinguished by its codifiable, transferable, structured, and measurable nature.

## Context/Example:
Key Characteristics: 
- **Codifiable** (can be written down or recorded)
- **Transferable** (easy to share and teach)
- **Structured** (follows clear patterns and rules)
- **Measurable** (can be tested and verified). Examples include technical documentation, standard operating procedures, academic textbooks, and formal training materials that can be systematically transmitted between individuals.

## System Components:
- **Individual Elements**: Discrete pieces of codifiable information (facts, procedures, rules, frameworks) that exist independently and can be documented in various formats
- **Interactions**: Formal transfer mechanisms (documentation, training, databases) that move knowledge between people; verification and testing processes that validate knowledge accuracy
- **Environment/Field**: The organizational and technological infrastructure that enables systematic knowledge capture, storage, retrieval, and transmission across time and contexts

## Connections:
- **Similar**: [[Codified knowledge]], [[Academic knowledge]], [[Standard operating procedures]]
- **Opposite**: [[Tacit Knowledge]], [[Intuitive understanding]], [[Implicit knowledge]]
- **Builds on**: [[Formal language systems]], [[Documentation practices]], [[Knowledge codification]]
- **Enables**: [[Knowledge management systems]], [[Training frameworks]], [[Standardized education]]

## Applications:
- **Onboarding Systems**: Create systematic training materials that reliably transfer critical testing and system knowledge to new hires
- **Test Documentation**: Create explicit test procedures, bug reporting standards, and quality frameworks that can be easily transferred to new team members
- **Knowledge Base Development**: Transform recurring problem-solutions into searchable, structured documentation that accelerates future troubleshooting

## Questions/Next Steps:
- [ ]  What tacit knowledge in my testing work should be converted to explicit documentation?
- [ ]  How can I balance the efficiency of explicit knowledge with the nuance of experiential learning?
- [ ]  What systems would best support capturing and organizing explicit knowledge in my team?
