## Core Concept/Principle:
Creativity is connecting different, sometimes seemingly unrelated things to create something that is useful in some way. Creative people are specially good at recognizing relationships and connections. The demands of creative people can push them to appear highly specialized on one thing or selfish although the opposite is often true.

## Context/Example:
First, divergently gather ideas, sources, and information points to form your knowledge base. Once you reach critical mass, switch to convergence mode to link them together coherently. Playing and tinkering with abstracted ideas—liberated from their original contexts—leads to insight and exceptional creative work.

## System Components:
- **Individual Elements**: Separate ideas, sources, concepts, and information pieces that exist independently in different domains or contexts
- **Interactions**: The recognition of patterns, relationships, and connections between seemingly unrelated elements; the active linking process in convergence mode
- **Environment/Field**: The cognitive/mental space that enables mode-switching between divergent and convergent thinking; the abstraction process that liberates ideas from original contexts

## Connections:
- **Similar**: [[Second Brain]], [[Note-taking (Zettelkasten method)]]
- **Opposite**: [[Linear thinking]], [[Single-domain expertise]]
- **Builds on**: [[Pattern recognition]], [[Abstraction principles]]
- **Enables**: [[Innovation]], [[Problem-solving]], [[Knowledge synthesis]]

## Applications:
**Knowledge Management**: Using divergent research followed by convergent synthesis for technical documentation

## Questions/Next Steps:
- [ ]  How can I create better environments for divergent thinking in my daily work?
- [ ]  What tools or practices help me switch more effectively between modes?
- [ ]  Which seemingly unrelated domains might inform my testing and systems work?
