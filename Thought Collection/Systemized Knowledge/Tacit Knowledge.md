## Core Concept/Principle:
Knowledge that is hard to express and isn't formally learned, based on people's experiences, actions, and behaviors. The unspoken, implicit part of knowledge that includes skills, intuitions, insights, and bodily sensations (like riding a bike, recognizing faces, interpreting moods). Tacit knowledge is essential to ALL knowledge - striving to remove personal elements would undermine knowledge itself rather than improve it.

## Context/Example:
Mathematical theory creation requires previous understanding and experiences, and mathematical theory application requires relating it to previous experiences. The idea of completely objective, experience-free knowledge is therefore self-contradictory. 

Polanyi's four aspects of tacit knowledge: 
- **Functional** (how it operates/its purpose)
- **Phenomenal** (what is subjectively experienced)
- **Semantic** (meaning/interpretation)
- **Ontological** (fundamental characteristics and relationships to the world).

## System Components:
- **Individual Elements**: Experience-based insights, intuitive understandings, behavioral patterns, and contextual awareness that exist within individuals but resist formal articulation
- **Interactions**: The process of awareness directing attention to relationships; the integration of previous experiences with new situations; the subjective interpretation that bridges understanding and application
- **Environment/Field**: The experiential context and relational web that gives tacit knowledge meaning; the impossibility of pure objectivity that makes personal understanding fundamental to all knowledge

## Connections:
- **Similar**: [[Intuitive understanding]], [[Experiential learning]], [[Embodied knowledge]], [[Professional judgment]]
- **Opposite**: [[Explicit Knowledge]], [[Formal documentation]], [[Objective procedures]], [[Codified information]]
- **Builds on**: [[Personal experience]], [[Contextual awareness]], [[Subjective interpretation]]
- **Enables**: [[Expert judgment]], [[Adaptive problem-solving]], [[Creative insight]], [[Contextual decision-making]]

## Applications:
- **System Troubleshooting**: The "feel" for when a system behavior indicates deeper issues - knowledge gained through years of observing patterns that can't be fully documented
- **Architectural Decision-Making**: Integrating multiple contextual factors (team capability, business constraints, technical trade-offs) in ways that resist formal documentation but guide sound choices
- **Mentoring and Leadership**: Transferring professional judgment through example and guided experience rather than explicit instruction

## Questions/Next Steps:
- [ ]  What tacit knowledge do I possess as a Test Lead that would be valuable to transfer to my team?
- [ ]  How can I create environments that enable tacit knowledge development in others?
- [ ]  Where am I trying to over-formalize knowledge that might be better transmitted through experience and mentoring?
