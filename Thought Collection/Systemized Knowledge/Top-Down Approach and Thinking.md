## Core Concept/Principle:
Starts with the big picture, then breaks down into smaller segments. Essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion. An overview is formulated first, specifying but not detailing first-level subsystems, then each subsystem is refined in greater detail across multiple levels until reduced to base elements. Driven by pre-existing knowledge, expectations, or context.

## Context/Example:
System analysis begins with overall architecture understanding, then progressively decomposes into subsystems and components. Applied across multiple domains: 

- **Cognitive Psychology** (conceptually-driven perception using mental frameworks)
- **Information Processing** (context and prior knowledge influencing data interpretation)
- **Problem-Solving** (starting with overall solution framework then adapting smaller elements)
- **AI/Computer Science** (structured rules and algorithms interpreting data).

## System Components:
- **Individual Elements**: The big picture overview, hierarchical subsystem levels, and base elements that emerge from decomposition; pre-existing knowledge and contextual frameworks that guide analysis
- **Interactions**: The progressive refinement process from high-level to detailed specifications; the reverse engineering analysis that reveals compositional relationships; the context-driven interpretation that shapes understanding
- **Environment/Field**: The domain knowledge and experiential context that enables meaningful decomposition; the framework of expectations and mental models that guide the breakdown process

## Connections:
- **Similar**: [[Hierarchical decomposition]], [[Framework-first design]], [[Deductive reasoning]], [[Systems architecture]]
- **Opposite**: [[Bottom-Up Approach and Thinking]], [[Data-driven analysis]], [[Inductive reasoning]]
- **Builds on**: [[Prior knowledge]], [[Mental models]], [[Contextual frameworks]], [[Domain expertise]]
- **Enables**: [[Strategic planning]], [[System design]], [[Structured problem-solving]], [[Architecture patterns]]

## Applications:
- **System Architecture Design**: Start with business requirements and overall system goals, then decompose into services, components, and implementation details guided by architectural patterns and constraints
- **Test Strategy Planning**: Begin with quality objectives and risk assessment, then break down into test levels, coverage areas, and specific test cases based on system understanding and experience
- **Problem Diagnosis**: Use domain knowledge and system understanding to hypothesize likely failure modes, then systematically narrow down to specific components and root causes
- **Team Leadership**: Start with business objectives and team goals, then decompose into individual responsibilities, skill development needs, and process improvements based on organizational context
- **Technical Learning**: Apply existing programming and systems knowledge to understand new technologies by mapping them to familiar patterns and frameworks before diving into specifics
- **Project Planning**: Begin with deliverable requirements and timeline constraints, then break down into phases, tasks, and resource allocation using project management experience
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Start with business impact and strategic value, then progressively provide technical detail appropriate to audience knowledge and decision-making needs

## Questions/Next Steps:
- [ ] Where am I missing the big picture by jumping too quickly into implementation details?
- [ ] How can I better leverage my existing knowledge and patterns to guide system decomposition?
- [ ] When should I use top-down vs. bottom-up approaches for different types of problems?
