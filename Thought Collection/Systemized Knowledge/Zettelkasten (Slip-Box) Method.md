## Core Concept/Principle:
A bottom-up note organization system using numbered indexing rather than hierarchical categories, prioritizing future connections between information. The system acts as external long-term memory, freeing mental resources while enabling idea combination and pattern recognition through three distinct note types.

## Context/Example:
Niklas Luhmann, German sociologist, used slip-boxes (Zettelk√§sten) with numerical indexing where related notes received similar indexes. 

He took three types of notes: 
- **Fleeting notes** (spontaneous ideas for temporary capture)
- **Literature notes** (content summaries from reading)
- **Permanent notes** (original ideas and information combinations stored separately). This enabled building note clusters, combining them, and preparing ordered sequences.

**Implementation Rules**: Write one note per idea, write for others using full sentences with disclosed sources and references, be precise and brief. Digital notes should fit on screen without scrolling. Notes derive value from context (not necessarily original context) - capture what resonates regardless of source.

## System Components:
- **Individual Elements**: Three distinct note types (fleeting, literature, permanent) that serve different cognitive functions and have different lifespans and storage requirements
- **Interactions**: Numerical indexing system that creates relationships between notes; clustering and combination processes that link related concepts across different sources and contexts
- **Environment/Field**: The slip-box system itself acting as content-agnostic external memory that prioritizes relevance and connection-making over rigid categorization

## Connections:
- **Similar**: [[Second Brain]], [[Note-taking systems]], [[External cognition]]
- **Opposite**: [[Hierarchical filing]], [[Top-down categorization]], [[Linear organization]]
- **Builds on**: [[Bottom-Up Approach and Thinking]], [[Emergent organization]]
- **Enables**: [[Knowledge synthesis]], [[Creative connections]], [[Long-term learning]]
## Applications:
**Test Documentation**: Create fleeting notes for bug observations, literature notes from testing articles/courses, permanent notes combining testing insights across projects

## Questions/Next Steps:
- [ ]  How can I implement this three-note system in Obsidian effectively?
- [ ]  What numbering/linking system would work best for my technical domain?
- [ ]  How might this approach change my current documentation and learning practices at work?
