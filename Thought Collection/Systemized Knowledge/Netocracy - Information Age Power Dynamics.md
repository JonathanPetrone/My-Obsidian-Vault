## Core Concept/Principle:

A social theory describing power structures in the information society where "netocrats" - those who control information networks - constitute the new ruling class. Power derives from network position, information flow control, and the ability to absorb, sort, generate, and share valuable information rather than traditional capital or position.

## Context/Example:

Seven principles define netocratic behavior: 
- **Build "attentionality"** (actively participate in information flow)
- **Focus on networks not individuals** (engage in exclusive information-sharing networks)
- **Master netiquette** (openness, generosity, knowledge sharing without self-assertion)
- **Embrace global mobility** (move where opportunities exist) 
- **Develop "dividual" identity** (multiple changing personalities/roles)
- **Think beyond traditional morality** (create own values through "affirmative nihilism")
- **Understand information as power** (critically examine and distinguish valuable information).

## System Components:

- **Individual Elements**: Netocrats with developed attentionality, dividual identities, and information mastery; exclusive networks that control valuable information flow; traditional power structures being displaced
- **Interactions**: Information exchange within networks, netiquette-governed relationships, global mobility patterns that follow opportunities; the displacement of traditional hierarchies by network-based power
- **Environment/Field**: The information society where data and connectivity determine influence; the global context that enables mobility and network formation; the post-traditional moral landscape that enables value creation

## Connections:

- **Similar**: [[Network effects]], [[Information asymmetry]], [[Digital nomadism]], [[Knowledge work]], [[Post-industrial society]]
- **Opposite**: [[Traditional hierarchies]], [[Geographic constraints]], [[Fixed identity]], [[Capital-based power]], [[Moral absolutism]]
- **Builds on**: [[Information theory]], [[Network theory]], [[Globalization]], [[Digital transformation]]
- **Enables**: [[Distributed power structures]], [[Information-based influence]], [[Global knowledge networks]], [[Adaptive identity]]

## Applications:

- **Professional Network Building**: Actively participate in technical communities, open source projects, and industry networks where valuable testing and architecture knowledge is exchanged rather than just consuming information
- **Knowledge Sharing Strategy**: Practice netiquette by generously sharing testing insights, system analysis, and problem-solving approaches without self-promotion, building reputation through valuable contributions
- **Career Mobility**: Develop location-independent skills and maintain global professional networks that enable movement to opportunities in different markets or remote work arrangements
- **Identity Management**: Cultivate different professional personas for different contexts (testing expert, systems thinker, team leader) while maintaining authentic core values and expertise
- **Information Curation**: Develop critical evaluation skills to distinguish valuable technical insights from noise, becoming a trusted filter and synthesizer of quality information for your networks
- **Strategic Positioning**: Focus on becoming central to information flows in testing and architecture communities rather than just climbing traditional organizational hierarchies
- **Value Creation**: Develop independent technical judgment and innovative approaches rather than just following established methodologies and conventional wisdom

## Questions/Next Steps:

- [ ] Which professional networks am I part of, and how can I contribute more valuable information to them?
- [ ] How can I develop better "attentionality" for filtering and sharing technical insights?
- [ ] What aspects of my professional identity could benefit from more flexibility and adaptation to different contexts?
