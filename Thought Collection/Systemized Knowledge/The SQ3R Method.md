## Core Concept/Principle:
A structured five-step reading comprehension method (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review) that transforms passive reading into active learning through progressive engagement and self-testing. The method emphasizes question formation, active recall, and personal restatement to ensure deep understanding.

## Context/Example:
1. **Survey**: Get overview by reading title, introduction/summary, headings, and visual aids.
2. **Question**: Form specific questions about structure and set learning objectives.
3. **Read**: Process one section at a time with questions in mind, reading slowly for difficult passages.
4. **Recite**: Ask questions aloud, take margin notes, and restate key points in your own words.
5. **Review**: Test yourself on created questions and refresh memory where needed.

## System Components:
- **Individual Elements**: Five distinct cognitive activities (surveying, questioning, reading, reciting, reviewing) that each serve specific learning functions and build comprehension incrementally
- **Interactions**: Sequential progression where each step informs and enhances the next; question formation drives focused reading; recitation reinforces comprehension; review validates understanding
- **Environment/Field**: The structured learning framework that transforms any text into an active learning system, regardless of content complexity or domain

## Connections:
- **Similar**: [[Active reading]], [[Spaced repetition]], [[Question-based learning]]
- **Opposite**: [[Passive reading]], [[Linear consumption]], [[Single-pass learning]]
- **Builds on**: [[Metacognitive strategies]], [[Self-testing principles]]
- **Enables**: [[Deep learning]], [[Knowledge retention]], [[Critical thinking]]

## Applications:
- **Technical Documentation**: Apply SQ3R when learning new testing frameworks, API documentation, or system architecture guides to ensure thorough understanding
- **Professional Development**: Use for processing industry reports, methodology books, or certification materials with systematic comprehension checking
- **Meeting Preparation**: Survey agenda and materials, form key questions, read background docs thoroughly, recite main points for clarity, review objectives before meeting
## Questions/Next Steps:
- [ ]  How can I adapt SQ3R for technical documentation and code review processes?
- [ ]  What types of work-related reading would benefit most from this systematic approach?
- [ ]  How might I combine this with my note-taking system for better retention?
