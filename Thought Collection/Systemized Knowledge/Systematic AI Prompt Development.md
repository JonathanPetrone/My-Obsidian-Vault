## Core Concept/Principle:
Treat AI prompt development like software development - with version control, testing datasets (evals), iterative improvement, and systematic feedback collection. The evaluation datasets are often more valuable than the prompts themselves.

## Context/Example: 
Maintain living documents tracking prompt failures, create test scenarios for prompt validation, use meta-prompting (feeding prompts back to AI for improvement), and build continuous refinement cycles.

## System Components:
- **Individual Elements**: Prompt versions, evaluation datasets, failure logs, improvement cycles
- **Interactions**: Systematic testing reveals prompt weaknesses; meta-prompting creates improvement suggestions
- **Environment/Field**: Requires development mindset and tooling for version control and testing
