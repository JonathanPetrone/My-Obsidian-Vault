## Core Concept/Principle:
Science's power doesn't come from handling complexity, but from its genius to know what to ignore. Successful science transforms intractable complex problems into solvable simple ones through strategic elimination, idealization, and separation of concerns.

## Context/Example:
Newton's planetary motion analysis: 

He started with ~10^30,000 equations for all solar system matter, then he ignored "small" celestial bodies, assumed only gravitational forces, used the sun's dominance to separate planet-sun pairs, which made him end up with ~10 solvable equations.

The reduction factor was astronomical - from computationally impossible to pencil-and-paper solvable.
## System Components:
- **Individual Elements:** Complex real-world phenomena with countless variables, forces, and interactions that resist direct analysis
- **Interactions:** The art of strategic simplification - knowing which variables to eliminate, which forces to ignore, which interactions to separate, and which details don't matter for the specific problem
- **Environment/Field:** The computational and conceptual limitations that force scientists to choose between tractable simplified models and intractable complex reality

## Reference:
 Weinberg's "An Introduction to General Systems Thinking" - demonstrating how Newton's genius lay not in computational power but in knowing what could be safely ignored, and why this strategy fails for medium-complexity systems

## Connections:
- **Similar:** [[Occam's Razor]], [[Model Reduction]], [[Dimensional Analysis]], [[Law of Effect]]
- **Opposite:** [[Brute Force Computation]], [[Complete Modeling]], [[Organized Complexity]]
- **Builds on:** [[Square Law of Computation]], [[Three Regions of Complexity]], [[Decomposition Methods]]
- **Enables:** [[Analytical Solutions]], [[Classical Physics]], [[Engineering Design]], [[Statistical Mechanics]]
## Applications:
- Understanding why physics works so well (aggressive simplification)
- Why engineering succeeds (ignore molecular details for bridge design)
- Why economics uses unrealistic assumptions (rational actors, perfect markets)
- Why some important systems resist traditional science (life, consciousness, organizations)
- Why general systems thinking emerged to handle what can't be simplified away.
## Questions/Next Steps:
- [ ] How do we identify which simplifications preserve essential behavior vs. destroy it?
- [ ] What new approaches might handle organized complexity without losing what makes it interesting?
