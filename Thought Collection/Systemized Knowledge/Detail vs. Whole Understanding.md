## Core Concept/Principle:
To understand something without talking about it, we need awareness of details, but focusing too much on details causes us to lose sight of the bigger picture. Understanding and the thing itself exist as two levels of reality, each with its own principles. The higher level relies on the lower level but cannot be fully explained by it. We need to see both the details of parts and the systems/overlapping systems that form the whole.

## Context/Example:
A chess game is controlled by principles that depend on following chess rules, but these principles cannot be explained just by the rules themselves. When analyzing a text closely by breaking it into smaller parts, this helps understanding but can also make it difficult to appreciate the text as a whole. The comprehensive entity emerges from but transcends its constituent elements.

## System Components:
- **Individual Elements**: Detailed parts, rules, and constituent components that form the foundational level of reality; the specific elements that can be explicitly analyzed and broken down
- **Interactions**: The emergence of higher-level principles from lower-level components; the tension between detailed focus and holistic perception; the dependency relationship where higher levels rely on but transcend lower levels
- **Environment/Field**: The observational framework that enables switching between detail-focused and whole-focused awareness; the overlapping systems context that gives meaning to both levels

## Connections:
- **Similar**: [[Emergence]], [[Systems thinking]], [[Gestalt perception]], [[Multi-level analysis]]
- **Opposite**: [[Reductionism]], [[Single-level thinking]], [[Either-or analysis]]
- **Builds on**: [[Atomism]], [[Holism]], [[Tacit Knowledge]], [[Embodied knowledge]]
- **Enables**: [[Complex system understanding]], [[Strategic thinking]], [[Integrated analysis]]

## Applications:
- **Problem Diagnosis**: Drilling into specific error logs and system metrics while maintaining awareness of systemic issues and organizational patterns that manifest at higher levels
- **System Architecture Analysis**: Understanding individual components (APIs, databases, services) while grasping emergent system properties (performance, reliability, security) that can't be reduced to component analysis alone

## Questions/Next Steps:
- [ ]  Where am I getting lost in details at the expense of seeing emergent patterns?
- [ ]  How can I develop the ability to fluidly shift between detail and whole-system awareness?
- [ ]  What higher-level principles emerge from my technical work that I'm not explicitly recognizing?
