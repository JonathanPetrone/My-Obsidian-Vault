Kahnemanns two systems

## System 1: Automatic, Fast, Unconscious

**What it does:**
- Pattern recognition (reading, face recognition, sensing danger)
- Instant judgments and intuitions
- Emotional responses
- Automatic skills (walking, driving familiar routes)

**How it works:**
- Constantly running in background
- Delivers strong conclusions at lightning speed
- Never pauses to question evidence quality
- **WYSIATI: "What You See Is All There Is"** - treats available evidence as complete and reliable

**Strengths:**
- Enables rapid response to genuine patterns (fire commander sensing wrong heat signature)
- Encodes vast expertise (chess masters' 50,000-100,000 positions)
- Allows functioning without conscious deliberation

**Weaknesses:**
- Insensitive to evidence quality
- Can't distinguish valid patterns from false positives (Virgin Mary in burnt toast)
- Generates compelling but wrong conclusions
- Performs attribute substitution without awareness

## System 2: Deliberate, Slow, Conscious

**What it is:**
- Everything you choose to focus on
- Conscious reasoning and analysis
- Deliberate calculation
- Scientific thinking and doubt

**How it works:**
- Requires attention and effort
- Can question assumptions
- Can evaluate evidence quality
- Can hold multiple hypotheses simultaneously

**The Problem:**
System 2 is expensive (cognitively) and lazy. It _trusts_ System 1's outputs unless given strong reason to intervene. This is necessary - we can't consciously deliberate every judgment - but it means **System 1's errors become System 2's conclusions**.
