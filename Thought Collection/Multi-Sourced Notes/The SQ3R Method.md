## Core Concept/Principle:
A structured five-step reading comprehension method (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review) that transforms passive reading into active learning through progressive engagement and self-testing. The method emphasizes question formation, active recall, and personal restatement to ensure deep understanding.

## Context/Example:
1. **Survey**: Get overview by reading title, introduction/summary, headings, and visual aids.
2. **Question**: Form specific questions about structure and set learning objectives.
3. **Read**: Process one section at a time with questions in mind, reading slowly for difficult passages.
4. **Recite**: Ask questions aloud, take margin notes, and restate key points in your own words.
5. **Review**: Test yourself on created questions and refresh memory where needed.
