## Core Concept/Principle:
Complex systems where new properties, behaviors, or patterns arise from component interactions—properties not present in any single component alone. Emergent properties are meaningful only at the system level and cannot be predicted by studying parts in isolation. The whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts through interaction-generated phenomena that challenge reductionist thinking.

## Context/Example:
Key Concepts: 
- **Emergent Properties** (new attributes from component interaction, like ant colony intelligence or bird flight capability)
- **Weak vs. Strong Emergence** (weak can be simulated/predicted like traffic jams, strong cannot be reduced like consciousness)
- **Scale Dependence** (properties visible only at certain scales)
- **Self-Organization** (patterns without central control).

Examples span nature (ant colonies, ecosystems), physics (phase transitions), social systems (culture, economics), and technology (complex engineered systems with unexpected outcomes).
