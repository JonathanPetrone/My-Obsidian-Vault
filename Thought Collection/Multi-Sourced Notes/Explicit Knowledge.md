## Core Concept/Principle:
Knowledge that can be easily documented, verbalized, and transferred through formal language. Systematic and codified information that enables ready sharing through various media like documents, databases, and formal training materials. Distinguished by its codifiable, transferable, structured, and measurable nature.

## Context/Example:
Key Characteristics: 
- **Codifiable** (can be written down or recorded)
- **Transferable** (easy to share and teach)
- **Structured** (follows clear patterns and rules)
- **Measurable** (can be tested and verified). Examples include technical documentation, standard operating procedures, academic textbooks, and formal training materials that can be systematically transmitted between individuals.
