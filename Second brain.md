Thus, building a second brain is our own   methodology for saving and systematically working with ideas, insights, and connections we’ve gained through our experience. This helps us standardize how we work with information and we can make it fit our lifestyle and needs.

We store information or insights we get through different sources (text, video, conversations etc.) with references in our notes which the becomes foundation of our Second Brain.

Like the normal brain our Second has inherent plasticity since the purpose of a single note or group of notes can and does change over time as your needs and goals change. Through habits like reviewing notes and re-organizing them we can form or Second Brain to fit our information needs.
