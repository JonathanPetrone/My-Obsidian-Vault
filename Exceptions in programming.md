Exceptions are unexpected events that occur within a system. Many languages provides features for detecting these exceptions and handling them. For this we write a specific blocks of code.

In Java, C#, C++, Swift, and Visual Basic, exceptions are handled by the keywords `catch` and `throw`.

An example from Java:

try {

    // possible nasty code

} catch(Exception e) {

    // code to handle the exception
}

So we try to execute the code in the `try` block and then handle problems in the `catch` block.
