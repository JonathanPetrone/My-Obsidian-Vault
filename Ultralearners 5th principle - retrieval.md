Trying to retrieve information is one of the best ways to learn. When practicing for a test as an example it is useful because it is similar to the activity of actual test taking later on. Another benefit is that we get actual feedback on our learning. This is very useful because we often lack the ability to gauge how much we have learned by ourselves, we tend to rely on our subjective experience on whether it felt easy or not. On the contrast ife we feel a struggle when we learn we might think  that we haven't learned anything.

Retrieval practice or taking tests is a practice when learning even when you are not "ready", if we have access to the correct answers available to us it's even better. It's even beneficial when we haven't learned what we want to retrieve yet. It might be because this retrieval practice reinforces our own search strategies when we look for information to help us learn or maybe it makes it easier to spot the information that holds the solution when we encounter it later on.

In general it is useful to wait a little bit after you have learned something to try to retrieve it, but not for too long so that you forget it. 

## What should we try to retrieve?
We mustn't try to retrieve everything, it's only natural that we pick some things to master and some things to only know on the surface level. By doing direct practice you might learn what is important, but direct practice on it's own often is not sufficient as you might not be able to concieve what isn't present in the context itself and might be useful in later situations.

## Methods for retrieval
It's sometimes hard to figure out how to design retrieving exercises or self-testing. Here are a few suggestions:

- **Tactic 1 - Flash cards**
	- Has a specific usage. Pairing between specific cue and a particular response.
- **Tactic 2 - Free recall**
	- Try to write down everything you remember after you've read something
- **Tactic 3 - The question-book method**
	- Rephrase what you learned into questions to be answered later (It's important to make useful questions!).
- **Tactic 4 - Self-generated challenges**
	- As you go through passive material, create challenges for yourself to solve later.
- **Tactic 5 - Closed-book learning**
	- Cut off the to search for hints and try to retrieve what you know.
