A recent study from Princeton University found that there is a certain kind of job that is least likely to be automated by machines in coming years. Surprisingly, it wasnâ€™t jobs that required advanced skills or years of training that were predicted to fare best. It was jobs that required the ability to convey â€œnot just information but a particular interpretation of information.â€5

This problemâ€”known as â€œself-ignoranceâ€â€”has been a major roadblock in the development of artificial intelligence and other computer systems. Because we cannot describe how we know what we know, it canâ€™t be programmed into software. The curse of computer scientists is our blessing, because this tacit knowledge represents the final frontier on which humans outperform machines. The jobs and endeavors that rely on tacit knowledge will be the last ones to be automated.
