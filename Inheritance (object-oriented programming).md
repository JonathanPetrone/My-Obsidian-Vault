Inheritance enables a class to inherit the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) of another class. This gives us the ability to create new classes by abstracting out (see: [[Abstraction (object-oriented programming)]]) common attributes and behaviors from another class. 

The superclass, or parent class (sometimes called base class), contains all the attributes and behaviors that are common to classes that inherit from it. 

The subclass, or child class (sometimes called derived class) is an extension of the superclass.

Dog (parent class) **->** French Bulldog (child class)

This relationship between a parent class and a child is often referred to as an _is-a relationship_. Thus in the above example French Bulldog is-a Dog (parent class)
