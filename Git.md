## What is Git?
Git is a distributed SCM (Source Code Management). It's a way to handle and working different versions of source code. 

With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. This lets us use these snapshot almost as save files in a video game, letting us jump from different points in history.

We can replace the current source code when we feel like it or “merge” it with what new code we have built, to create a new baseline for our work. This means that as long as there is more than a copy of the code, we are immune to some of the risks that comes with a centralized storage point. 

## The three stages of files within git
- **Untracked:** the file exists, but is not part of git's version control
- **Staged:** the file has been added to git's version control but changes have not been committed
- **Committed:** the change has been committed
