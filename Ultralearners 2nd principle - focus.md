Scott H. Young writes about three different areas relating to our focus which impacts our learning. (This is the second of nine principles for "ultralearners")

- Starting (procrastination)
- Sustaining
- Optimizing

## How do we handle struggles with starting?
If we are procrastinators the first step is to recognize that we are procrastinating. Then we might ask ourselves: Why? Is it because we dont wan't to do the thing or that we rather do something else? Our feelings might reveal the underlying cause which we then can confront in a constructive manner.

Often procrastination comes from an impulse and a way to handle this could be to endure a very short burst of unpleasantness (doing something for like 5 minutes) and then over time make the sessions longer.

## How do we handle struggles with sustaining focus?
The best way to handle our limited ability to focus for extended periods of time is to dedicate small portions of time and alternate between topics and activities.

We also want to look for distractions in:
- Our environment
- The task
- Our mind (ex. negative thoughts)

## How do we handle struggles with optimizing focus?
Optimizing has to do with the quality and direction of our focus. Depending on the task at hand we might want to change approach.

For example, dealing with complex problems might benefit from a relaxed or versatile approach to focus. And narrow problems might benefit from a very switched on and directed type of focus.
