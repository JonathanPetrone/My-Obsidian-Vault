Great! Here are the key points Kastrup makes about the limitations of science:

**On quantities versus qualities:** Kastrup argues that science operates entirely through quantities—measurements like length, mass, temperature. These are descriptions of experience, not the thing itself. Qualities (what something actually feels, looks, or sounds like when directly experienced) are the fundamental reality, while quantities are abstractions science creates to communicate and predict. Science can only describe quantities; it cannot describe qualities themselves.

**On the distinction between phenomena and noumena:** He points out that materialism claims the world is nothing but what it appears to be in measurement—that the thing-in-itself (noumena) is identical to its appearance (phenomena). This is philosophically problematic because it means denying that anything has an inner nature beyond how it appears to observation.

**On the problem of consciousness:** Science fundamentally cannot explain consciousness through reduction to unconscious matter. Kastrup argues this is incoherent "in principle"—like trying to reduce the number five to a marital status. Consciousness requires an "inner being," an ontological ground beyond measurement, which materialism by definition cannot address.

**On what science can and cannot do:** Science is effective at describing patterns and making predictions through mathematics, but this descriptive power shouldn't be confused with explaining the fundamental nature of reality. Science tells us how things behave, not what they fundamentally are.

The core limitation Kastrup identifies is that science is a tool for quantifying and predicting observable patterns, but it cannot access or explain the qualitative, inner nature of reality—including consciousness.
