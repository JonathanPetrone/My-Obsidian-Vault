Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is hard to express, it is a type of knowledge that isn't formally learned. This type of knowledge is based on people's experiences, actions and behaviors. 

We can only understand the first part of what is tacitly known by using our awareness of it to pay attention to what it relates to.  As an example we can only create a mathematical theory by using our previous understanding and experiences, and we can only use a mathematical theory by applying it to our previous experiences. Therefore, the idea of a mathematical theory of experience that completely removes personal understanding and experiences is self-contradictory and not logical.

Polanskyi argues that there's a challenge in finding a way to have a more reliable understanding of things, instead of relying on the ideal of objectivity. This is what the theory of tacit knowledge should help us achieve.

There are differet aspects to tacit knowledge according to Polanyi:
- **The functional** - the way it operates or the purpose it serves
- **The phenomenal** - what is subjectively experienced
- **The semantic** - its meaning or interpretation
- **The ontological** - the fundamental characteristics of the thing in question, and how it relates to other things and to the world as a whole
