Creativity is connecting different, seemingly unrelated things to create something that is useful in some way. Creative people are specially good at recognizing relationships and connections.

One key to creativity work is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame. T. Forte in his book calls this distinction of modes of working as "divergence mode" and "convergence mode", respectively. 

First you would divergently gather a group of ideas, sources, or points that will form the backbone of your thougths and information base. Once you have a critical mass information to work with, you switch into convergence mode and link them together in an order that makes sense.

Playing and tinkering with ideas is what leads to insight, exceptional texts or creative work in general. To be able to play with ideas we want to merge to a whole, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of abstraction and re-specification.
