If we double the number of equations we need a computer 4 times as powerful. (2²)

Example from the book, of a system containing two objects:

-   First, we need calculations for the objects’ isolated behavior x2.
-   Second, the interaction of the objects
-   Third, calculations if neither of the objects is present (Weinberg calls this the “field” equation)
