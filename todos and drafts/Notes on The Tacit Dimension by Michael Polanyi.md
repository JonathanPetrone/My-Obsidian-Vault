Polanyi shows that “tacit knowledge” that cannot be easily formalized and put into exact words has a sweeping presence in the world, and he goes on to argue that it is also a central feature of our knowledge of that world.

One implication that Polanyi draws from this perspective is that “the process of formalizing all knowledge to the exclusion of any tacit knowledge is self-defeating.

The importance of tacit knowledge has implications, Polanyi argues, for the impossibility of depersonalizing knowledge and the difficulty of seeking objectivity in the form of personal detachment.

Hence thinking is not only necessarily intentional, as Brentano has taught: it is also necessarily fraught with the roots that it embodies. It has a from-to structure.

Gestalt psychology has demonstrated that we may know a physiognomy by integrating our awareness of its particulars without being able to identify these particulars, and my analysis of knowledge is closely linked to this discovery of Gestalt psychology

However, I am looking at Gestalt, on the contrary, as the outcome of an active shaping of experience performed in the pursuit of knowledge. This shaping or integrating I hold to be the great and indispensable tacit power by which all knowledge is discovered and, once discovered, is held to be true.

Such is the functional relation between the two terms of tacit knowing: we know the first term only by relying on our awareness of it for attending to the second.

Here we have the basic definition of the logical relation between the first and second term of a tacit knowledge. It combines two kinds of knowing. We know the electric shock, forming the second term, by attending to it, and hence the subject is specifiably known. But we know the shock-producing particulars only by relying on our own awareness of them for attending to something else, namely the electric shock, and

But there is a significance in the relation of the two terms of tacit knowing which combines its functional and phenomenal aspects. When the sight of certain syllables makes us expect an electric shock, we may say that they signify the approach of a shock. This is their meaning to us. We could say, therefore, that when shock syllables arouse an apprehension in us, without our being able to identify the syllables which arouse it, we know these syllables only in terms of their meaning

From the three aspects of tacit knowing that I have defined so far—the functional, the phenomenal, and the semantic—we can deduce a fourth aspect, which tells us what tacit knowing is a knowledge of. This will represent its ontological aspect. Since tacit knowing establishes a meaningful relation between two terms, we may identify it with the understanding of the comprehensive entity which these two terms jointly constitute. Thus the proximal term represents the particulars of this entity, and we can say, accordingly, that we comprehend the entity by relying on our awareness of its particulars for attending to their joint meaning

Our body is the ultimate instrument of all our external knowledge, whether intellectual or practical. In all our waking moments we are relying on our awareness of contacts of our body with things outside for attending to these things. Our own body is the only thing in the world which we normally never experience as an object, but experience always in terms of the world to which we are attending from our body.

But our awareness of our body for attending to things outside it suggests a wider generalization of the feeling we have of our body. Whenever we use certain things for attending from them to other things, in the way in which we always use our own body, these things change their appearance. They appear to us now in terms of the entities to which we are attending from them, just as we feel our own body in terms of the things outside to which we are attending from our body. In this sense we can say that when we make a thing function as the proximal term of tacit knowing, we incorporate it in our body—or extend our body to include it—so that we come to dwell in it.

We meet with another indication of the wide functions of indwelling when we find acceptance to moral teachings described as their interiorization. To interiorize is to identify ourselves with the teachings in question, by making them function as the proximal term of a tacit moral knowledge, as applied in practice. This establishes the tacit framework for our moral acts and judgments. And we can trace this kind of indwelling to logically similar acts in the practice of science. To rely on a theory for understanding nature is to interiorize it. For we are attending from the theory to things seen in its light, and are aware of the theory, while thus using it, in terms of the spectacle that it serves to explain. This is why mathematical theory can be learned only by practicing its application: its true knowledge lies in our ability to use it.

The meticulous dismembering of a text, which can kill its appreciation, can also supply material for a much deeper understanding of it. In these cases, the detailing of particulars, which by itself would destroy meaning, serves as a guide to their subsequent integration and thus establishes a more secure and more accurate meaning of them.

Take the case of a machine. One can learn to use it skillfully, without knowing exactly how it works. But the engineer’s understanding of its construction and operation goes much deeper. We possess a practical knowledge of our own body, but the physiologist’s theoretical knowledge of it is far more revealing.

Therefore: a mathematical theory can be constructed only by relying on prior tacit knowing and can function as a theory only within an act of tacit knowing, which consists in our attending from it to the previously established experience on which it bears. Thus the ideal of a comprehensive mathematical theory of experience which would eliminate all tacit knowing is proved to be self-contradictory and logically unsound

It appears, then, that to know that a statement is true is to know more than we can tell and that hence, when a discovery solves a problem, it is itself fraught with further intimations of an indeterminate range, and that furthermore, when we accept the discovery as true, we commit ourselves to a belief in all these as yet undisclosed, perhaps as yet unthinkable, consequences.

The recognition of a person in the performance of a skill or in the conduct of a game of chess is intrinsic to the understanding of these matters. We must surmise that we are faced with some coordinated performance, before we can even try to understand it, and must go on trying to

pick out the features that are essential to the performance, with a view to the action felt to be at work in it. Hence, the question much discussed by philosophers of how we can infer the existence of other minds from observing their external workings does not arise, for we never do observe these workings in themselves. Indeed, many of them we could not identify, even after we had successfully integrated them with our knowledge of a personal performance, any more than its performer could tell us, except quite vaguely, what the particulars are that his performance co-ordinates.

But neither problems nor minds should on this account be set far apart from other things. For an inanimate solid object, too, is known by understanding its particulars, from which we attend to it as an object.

Tacit knowing of a coherent entity relies on our awareness of the particulars of the entity for attending to it; and (2) if we switch our attention to the particulars, this function of the particulars is canceled and we lose sight of the entity to which we had attended. The ontological counterpart of this would be (1) that the principles controlling a comprehensive entity would be found to rely for their operations on laws governing the particulars of the entity in themselves; and (2) that at the same time the laws governing the particulars in themselves would never account for the organizing principles of a higher entity which they form.

Return to our knowledge of a game of chess and the game itself. The playing of a game of chess is an entity controlled by principles which rely on the observance of the rules of chess; but the principles controlling the game cannot be derived from the rules of chess. The two terms of tacit knowing, the proximal, which includes the particulars, and the distal, which is their comprehensive meaning, would then be seen as two levels of reality, controlled by distinctive principles.

While the declared aim of current biology is to explain all the phenomena of life in terms of the laws of physics and chemistry, its actual practice is to attempt an explanation in terms of a machinery, based on the laws of physics and chemistry. Biologists think that the substitution of this task for their declared aim is justified, for they assume that a machine based on the laws of physics is explicable by the laws of physics. My first point is that biologists are mistaken in assuming this

But how can a machine which, as an inanimate body, obeys the laws of physics and chemistry fail to be determined by these laws? How can it follow both the laws of nature and its own operational principles as a machine? How does the shaping of inanimate matter in a machine make it capable of success or failure? The answer lies in the word: shaping. Natural laws may mold inanimate matter into distinctive shapes, such as the spheres of the sun and the moon, and into such patterns as that of the solar system. Other shapes can be imposed on matter artificially, and yet without infringing the laws of nature. The operational principles of machines are embodied in matter by such artificial shaping. These principles may be said to govern the boundary conditions of an inanimate system—a set of conditions that is explicitly left undetermined by the laws of nature. Engineering provides a determination of such boundary conditions. And this is how an inanimate system can be subject to a dual control on two levels: the operations of the upper level are artificially embodied in the boundaries of the lower level which is relied on to obey the laws of inanimate nature, i.e., physics and chemistry.

Inanimate nature is self-contained, achieving nothing, relying on nothing and, hence, unerring. This fact defines the most essential innovation achieved by the emergence of life from the inanimate. A living function has a result which it may achieve or fail to achieve. Processes that are expected to achieve something have a value that is inexplicable in terms of processes having no such value. The logical impossibility of such explanation may be affiliated to the dictum that nothing that ought to be, can be determined by knowing what is. Hence a principle not present in the inanimate must come into operation when it gives birth to living things.

Each new branch of biology that was developed to cover the increasingly complex function of higher animals sets up additional standards, to which the observer expects the animal to measure up. And this intensification of criticism coincides with an increasing enrichment of relations between the critic and his object. We know an animal, as we know a person, by entering into its performance, and we appreciate it as an individual, in the interests of which these performances have their meaning. Even at the lowest, purely vegetative level, we accept the interests of the animal as the standard by which our own interest in the animal is determined. All biology is, in this sense, convivial. But this conviviality rises to emotional concern as the animal approaches the human level. We then become aware of its sentience, of its intelligence, and above all of its emotional relations to ourselves.

We have seen that tacit knowledge dwells in our awareness of particulars while bearing on an entity which the particulars jointly constitute. In order to share this indwelling, the pupil must presume that a teaching which appears meaningless to start with has in fact a meaning which can be discovered by hitting on the same kind of indwelling as the teacher is practicing. Such an effort is based on accepting the teacher’s authority.

It might seem impossible to compare the complex scientific value of marginal contributions over such different areas as, for example, astronomy and medicine. Yet I believe this is in fact done, or at least is reasonably approached in practice. It is done by applying a principle that I have not seen described elsewhere, although it is used in various fields; I would call it the principle of mutual control. It consists, in the present case, of the simple fact that scientists keep watch over each other. Each scientist is both subject to criticism by all others and encouraged by their appreciation of him. This is how scientific opinion is formed, which enforces scientific standards and regulates the distribution of professional opportunities. It

The structure of authority exercised over a society of explorers is different from that to which a dogmatic society submits. Take once more the example of science. I have spoken of the principle of mutual control through which each scientist independently plays his part in maintaining scientific traditions over an immense domain of inquiry of which he knows virtually nothing. A society of explorers is controlled throughout by such mutually imposed authority. The pressure exercised by literary and artistic circles is notorious. They control access to public recognition much as scientific opinion controls it for science. Their professional opinion commands lay assent just as scientific opinion does. There are, of course, differences: reliance on secondhand authority reaches less far in literature and art than in science, and divisions between rival opinions go deeper. In our society, ideas about morality are also actively cultivated by different circles of mutual appreciation, which are deeply divided against each other; and in politics these circles are deliberately organized as rivals.

It is the image of humanity immersed in potential thought that I find revealing for the problems of our day. It rids us of the absurdity of absolute self-determination, yet offers each of us the chance of creative originality, within the fragmentary area which circumscribes our calling. It provides us with the metaphysical grounds and the organizing principle of a Society of Explorers. Yet the question remains whether this solution will satisfy us. Can we recognize the limitations it imposes on us? Must not such a fragmented society appear adrift, irresponsible, selfish, apparently chaotic? I have praised the freedom of a community where coherence is spontaneously established by self-co-ordination, authority is exercised by equals over each other, all tasks are set by each to himself. But where are they all going? Nobody knows; they are just piling up works soon to be forgotten.
