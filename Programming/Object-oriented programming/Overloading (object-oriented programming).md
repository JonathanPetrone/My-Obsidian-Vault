Overloading is creating similar methods that contain similar signatures (method name or parameter list) but are not identical, something has to differ. This allows us to use a method over and over again.

In C# and Java the return type of the method is not part of the signature, and thus if it the only thing differentiating the methods you create it will cause an error.
