One of the primary goals of OO-programming is to model real world systems in ways similar to the way we think.  Object-oriented languages uses a bottom-up approach where each object/class is identified first.

In a bottom-up approach way of designing systems, individual parts of the system are specified in detail. The parts are then linked to form larger components, which are in turn linked until a complete system is formed.

Some of the main concepts of OOP are:

- Abstraction
- Encapsualtion
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism 
- Composition
- Classes 
- Objects
