Dependency injection decouples your classâ€™s construction from the construction of its dependencies. So rather than creating objects inside of objects, creating dependencies and highly coupled classes, we will instead inject objects from the outside via the parameter list. 

Interfaces can help us with this, so think in terms of Object X implements Y. (see: [[Classes (object-oriented programming)]])

We can inject via the constructor or by a setter.

Dependency injection is useful becuase both inheritance and aggregation by composition (embeddding all components in a single unit) can create highly coupled classes.
