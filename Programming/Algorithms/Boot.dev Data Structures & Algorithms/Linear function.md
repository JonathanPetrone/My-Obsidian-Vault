A **linear function** is a function that can be written in the form:

f(x)=mx+b

where:
- m is the **slope** (rate of change),
- b is the **y-intercept** (value when x=0).

### Key characteristics of a linear function:
- Its graph is a **straight line**.
- It has **constant rate of change**, meaning the difference in output is proportional to the difference in input.
- It is **first-degree**, since the highest exponent of x is 1. If it was a x^2 it would be second-degree.
 
For example, f(x)=2x+3 is a linear function with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3.

Let me know if you want to see how it differs from affine or constant functions too.
