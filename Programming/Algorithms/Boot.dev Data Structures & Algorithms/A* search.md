A* (A-star) search is a popular **pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm** used to find the **shortest path** from a **start node** to a **goal node**, especially when dealing with weighted graphs (e.g., maps, grids, networks).

A* search is **very similar** to Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, with one key difference: **A* adds a heuristic** to guide the search toward the goal more efficiently.
