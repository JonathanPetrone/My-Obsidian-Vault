Linear programming (LP) is a method used to **optimize a linear objective function**, subject to a set of **linear constraints** (which can be equalities or inequalities). It's widely used in many fields to solve problems involving limited resources.

In short, linear programming helps answer questions like:
> _"What is the best possible outcome I can get, given these constraints?"_
