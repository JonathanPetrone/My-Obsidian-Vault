Use Forking (there is no fork command in Git) from Github when you want to eventually contribute to a repo.

**Example steps:**
1. Fork main repo
2. Clone down forked repo to own environment
3. Make changes to the main branch (or other) in the forked repo
4. Push changes to the main branch (or other)
5. Open PR with the changes from the for onto the original repo
