### Communication Protocols and working with brokers
You need a **library or client SDK** to communicate with a message broker because each broker has its own communication protocol and API.

All brokers use a communication protocol to define how messages are sent, received, and understood. The choice of protocol depends on the broker and its intended use case.

- **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)**
    - Lightweight protocol, ideal for IoT and low-bandwidth applications.
    - Used in brokers like **Eclipse Mosquitto, EMQX**.
- **AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)**
    - More feature-rich, supports message queuing, transactions, and acknowledgments.
    - Used in **RabbitMQ, Apache Qpid**.
- **HTTP/REST**
    - Common in cloud-based messaging services.
    - Used in **Google Pub/Sub, AWS SNS, Azure Service Bus**.
- **gRPC**
    - Efficient, high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) protocol.
    - Used in **NATS, some Kafka implementations**.
- **Kafkaâ€™s Proprietary Protocol**
    - Apache Kafka uses its own custom protocol over TCP for high-throughput messaging.
- **Redis Pub/Sub (Custom TCP Protocol)**
    - Lightweight publish-subscribe system.
    - Uses a simple TCP-based protocol for real-time event streaming.
