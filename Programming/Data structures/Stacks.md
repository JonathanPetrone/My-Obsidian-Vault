A [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) is a data structure that stores ordered items. It's _like_ a list, but its design is more restrictive. It only allows items to be added or removed from the top of the stack.

- Stacks are often used in the real world for:
    - Function call management
    - Undo/redo functionality
    - Expression evaluation
