In software testing, people usually talk about "flakiness" as unreliable tests. Maybe a series of tests are executed several times without any change to the system or the environment but still the results are inconsistent on one of the same tests, this means that one could point to that test and say it is flaky.

There are a variety of variables as to why the test in the previous example could exhibit such behavior. Maybe it's a problem with how the test is designed? There may be extraneous factors we have not yet thought of.
