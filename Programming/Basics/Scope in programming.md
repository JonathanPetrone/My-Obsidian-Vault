Scope is the area of the program where an item (be it variable, constant, function, etc.) that has an identifier name is recognized. Scope is an important concept for modularization.

There are different kind of scopes, for an example:

- Global scope
- Local scope

In OOP-languages attributes (and methods) exist within a particular scope. Scope is outlined in Java, C#, C++, and Swift by curly braces `{}`.
