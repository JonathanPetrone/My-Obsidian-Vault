In agile software development  the “three amigos”,  sometimes get referenced which points us to three main perspectives to examine in an increment of work before, during, and after development

-   Business – What problem are we trying to solve?
-   Development – How might we build a solution to solve that problem?
-   Testing – What about this, what could possibly happen?
