Building a counter to work concurrently.
## Mutex
A Mutex is a mutual exclusion lock. The zero value for a Mutex is an unlocked mutex.

```
type Counter struct {
	mu sync.Mutex
	value int
}

func (c *Counter) Inc() {
	c.mu.Lock()
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
	c.value++
}
```

## go vet
Remember to use go vet in your build scripts as it can alert you to some subtle bugs in your code before they hit your poor users.

## sync.WaitGroup
A WaitGroup waits for a collection of goroutines to finish. The main goroutine calls Add to set the number of goroutines to wait for. Then each of the goroutines runs and calls Done when finished. At the same time, Wait can be used to block until all goroutines have finished.

```
t.Run("it runs safely concurrently", func(t *testing.T) {
	wantedCount := 1000
	counter := Counter{}

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(wantedCount)

	for i := 0; i < wantedCount; i++ {
		go func() {
			counter.Inc()
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
	wg.Wait()

	assertCounter(t, counter, wantedCount)
})
```

## Wrapping up

We've covered a few things from the [sync package](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/)

- `Mutex` allows us to add locks to our data
- `WaitGroup` is a means of waiting for goroutines to finish jobs
