## For syntax
The `for` syntax is very unremarkable and follows most C-like languages.

```
func Repeat(character string) string {
	var repeated string
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		repeated = repeated + character
	}
	return repeated
}
```

Unlike other languages like C, Java, or JavaScript there are no parentheses surrounding the three components of the for statement and the braces `{ }` are always required.

## Benchmarking
Writing [benchmarks](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Benchmarks) in Go is another first-class feature of the language and it is very similar to writing tests.

```
func BenchmarkRepeat(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		Repeat("a")
	}
}
```

When the benchmark code is executed, it runs `b.N` times and measures how long it takes.

The amount of times the code is run shouldn't matter to you, the framework will determine what is a "good" value for that to let you have some decent results.
