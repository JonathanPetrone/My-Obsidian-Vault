Go source files can only have one `package` per directory. Make sure that your files are organised into their own packages.

**Example:**

learnGoWithTests
    |
    |-> helloworld
    |    |- hello.go
    |    |- hello_test.go    
    |
    |-> integers
    |    |- adder_test.go
    |
    |- go.mod
    |- README.md

### Examples

If you really want to go the extra mile you can make [examples](https://blog.golang.org/examples). You will find a lot of examples in the documentation of the standard library.

Often code examples that can be found outside the codebase, such as a readme file often become out of date and incorrect compared to the actual code because they don't get checked.

As with typical tests, examples are functions that reside in a package's `_test.go` files. Add the following `ExampleAdd` function to the `adder_test.go` file.

```
func ExampleAdd() {
	sum := Add(1, 5)
	fmt.Println(sum)
	// Output: 6
}
```

## Wrapping up

What we have covered:

- More practice of the TDD workflow

- Integers, addition

- Writing better documentation so users of our code can understand its usage quickly

- Examples of how to use our code, which are checked as part of our tests
