**Regarding this approach in systems thinking:**
Bottom-up processing is a type of information processing based on incoming data from the environment to form a perception. A bottom-up approach is the piecing together of systems to give rise to more complex systems, thus making the original systems sub-systems of the emergent system. 

In a bottom-up approach the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. 

This strategy often resembles a "seed" model, by which the beginnings are small but eventually grow in complexity and completeness.
