-> Survey -> Question -> Read -> Recite -> Review.

**Survey**
The first step in the method is getting a general overview of what you’ll be reading. If you go dive in without surveying first, you are going in blind, without understanding where you are going and what you are trying to accomplish. 

- *Read the title*
- *Read the introduction and/or summary* 
- *Notice each boldface heading and subheading*
- *Notice any graphics*
- *Notice reading aids*
	- – Italics, bold face print, chapter objective, and end-of -chapter questions are all included to help you sort, comprehend, and remember.

**Question**
This stage will help your mind engage and concentrate with the material.
You’ll take a slightly closer look at the structure of the book and form some questions you wanted answered or set up the objectives you want to achieve.

What specific answers are you hoping to find in your studies? Write them down. You don’t have to answer the questions yet—you just need to know how you’re going to record them when you do.

**Read**
In this stage you’re finally ready to dive into the material. Read one section at a time with your questions in mind and look for the answers. Recognize when you need to make up some new questions.

Be patient with the material and with yourself. If a passage is difficult to understand, read it extremely slowly. If you aren’t getting a sense of clarity about a certain part, stop, go back to the beginning, and reread it. 

Any other resources you use, use them exactly the way you’d use the book in the reading phase: deliberately and persistently, with the goal of fully understanding each concept you’re being taught.

**Recite**
The aim of the reciting phase is to reorient your mind and attention to focus and learn more fully as you go along. In other words, this step is about literal recitation.

Ask questions—out loud, verbally—about what you’re reading. This is also the point where you take copious notes in the margins of the text and underline or highlight key points. However, it’s important to restate these points _in your own words_.

**Review**
Once you've finished the entire chapter using the preceding steps, go back over the questions you create for every heading. See if you can still answer them. If not, look back and refresh your memory and then continue.
