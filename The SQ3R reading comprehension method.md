The method follows these steps:

## **Survey**
The first step in the method is getting a general overview of what you’ll be reading 
- *Read the title*
- *Read the introduction and/or summary* 
- *Notice each boldface heading and subheading*
- *...plus things like graphics or reading aids*

## **Question**
Take a slightly closer look at the structure of the book and form some questions you wanted answered or set up the objectives you want to achieve.

## **Read**
Read one section at a time with your questions in mind and look for the answers. Recognize when you need to make up some new questions. If a passage is difficult to understand, read it extremely slowly. Aim to fully understanding each concept you’re being taught.

## **Recite**
Ask questions—out loud, verbally—about what you’re reading. This is also the point where you take copious notes in the margins of the text and underline or highlight key points. However, it’s important to restate these points _in your own words_.

## **Review**
Once you've finished the entire chapter using the preceding steps, go back over the questions you create for every heading. See if you can still answer them. If not, look back and refresh your memory and then continue.
